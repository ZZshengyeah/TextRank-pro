we ar  particularli interest in the implic of market barrier for the latter two. the model present here allow for an  investig into the effect of market barrier to be carri out in a complex environ where at everi time period each agent in a popul must decid which on of a set of product to purchas. these decis ar base on  multiattribut inform gather by person product trial as well as from the referr of agent. agent us thi gather inform to search for a product that exce their  satisfact threshold on all attribut - so that the agent mai be said to be satisf rather than optimis (e.g. [15]). market barrier mai act to influenc an agent to continu to us a product that is no longer offer satisfactori  perform. we allow agent to hold differ opinion about the perform of a product, so that as a result a referr from anoth agent mai not lead to a satisfi experi. agent therefor adjust their evalu of the valid of other agent" referr accord to the success of past  referr, and us these evalu to judg whether or not to make us of ani further referr. the level of  satisfact provid to an agent by a product is itself inher dynam, be subject to random fluctuat in product perform as well as a tendenc for an agent to discount the perform of a product thei have us for a long time - a process akin to habitu. 2. background 2.1 word-of-mouth commun much of the work done on word-of-mouth commun in the context of social psycholog and market research ha focus on it form and determin, suggest that word-of-mouth aris in three possibl wai: it mai be  induc by a particular transact or product experi [11], particularli when that transact ha been an especi good or bad on [1]; it mai be solicit from other [10], usual when the task involv is difficult, ambigu, or new [7]; and it mai come about when talk of product and brand aris in the cours of inform convers,  particularli when a ‘passion for the subject" is present [4].  wordof-mouth becom more influenti when the sourc of the commun is credibl, with credibl decis base larg on on or a combin of evalu of profession qualif, inform train, social distanc [7], and  similar of view and experi [3]. the role of word-of-mouth commun on the behaviour of complex system ha been studi in both analyt and simul model. the analyt work in [8] investig the condit under which word-of-mouth lead to  conform in behaviour and the adopt of social effici  outcom (e.g. choos an altern that is on averag better than anoth), find that conform of behaviour aris when agent ar expos to word-of-mouth commun from onli a small number of other agent, but that thi  conform mai result in social ineffici outcom where the tendenc toward conform is so strong that it overwhelm the influenc of the superior payoff provid by the social effici outcom. simul-base investig of  wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focus on develop strategi for ensur that a system reach an equilibrium level where all agent ar satisfi, larg by learn about the  effect of other" referr or by vari the degre of  inertia in individu behaviour. these studi have found that, given a suffici number of servic provid, honest  referr lead to faster converg to satisfactori distribut than deceit on, and that both form of word-of-mouth provid better perform than none at all. the  simul framework allow for a more complex model of the environ than the analyt model, in which referr ar at random and onli two choic ar avail, and the work in [6] in particular is a close anteced of the work  present in thi paper, our main contribut be to includ network structur and the constraint impos by market barrier as addit effect. 2.2 market barrier the extent to which market barrier ar influenti in affect system behaviour draw attent mostli from economist interest in how barrier distort competit and market interest in how barrier distort consum choic. while the formalis of the idea that  satisfact drive purchas behaviour can be trace back to the work of fishbein and ajzen [9] on reason choic, nearli all writer, includ fishbein and ajzen, recognis that thi relationship can be thwart by circumst (e.g. [17]). a us typolog of market barrier distinguish  ‘transact" barrier associ with the monetari cost of  chang (e.g. in financi servic), ‘learn" barrier associ with decid to replac well-known exist product, and ‘contractu" barrier impos legal constraint for the term of the contract [12]. a differ typolog [5] introduc the addit aspect of ‘relat" barrier aris from  person relationship that mai be interwoven with the us of a particular product. there is gener littl empir evid on the  relationship between the creation of barrier to switch and the  retent of a custom base, and to the best of our knowledg no previou work us agent-base model to gener empir find. burnham et al. [5] find that perceiv market barrier account for nearli twice the varianc in  intent to stai with a product than that explain by  satisfact with the product (30% and 16% respect), and that so-call relat barrier ar consider more  influenti than either transact or learn barrier. further, thei find that switch cost ar perceiv by consum to exist even in market which ar fluid and where barrier would seem to be weak. simpli put, market barrier appear to plai a greater role in what peopl do than satisfact; and their presenc mai be more pervas than is gener thought. 3. model framework 3.1 product perform evalu we us a problem represent in which, at each time period, everi agent must decid which on of a set of  product to choos. let a = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agent, b = {bi}i=1...n be the set of product, and c = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attribut on which the choic decis is to be base i.e. the decis to be made is a multiattribut choic on. let fj : b → [0, 1] be an increas function  provid the intrins perform of a product on attribut j (so that 0 and 1 ar the worst- and best-possibl perform respect), and sij : a × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subject opinion function of agent. the intrins perform of 388 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) product i on attribut j is given by fj (bi). howev, the subject opinion of the level of perform (of product i on attribut j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)). all subsequ model is base on these subject  perform rate. for the purpos of thi paper, each agent belong to on of three equal-size group, with each group possess it own subject perform rate. we assum that the subject perform rate ar not known a priori by the agent, and it is their task to  discov these rate by a combin of person explor and referr gather. in order to model thi process we  introduc the notion of perceiv perform rate at time t, denot by pij(ak, fj (bi), t). initi, all perceiv  perform rate ar set to zero, so that the initi select of a product is done randomli. subsequ variat in product perform over time is model us two quantiti: a random perturb jkt appli at each purchas occas ensur that the experi of a particular product can vari over purchas occas for the same agent, and a  habitu discount factor hikt tend to decreas the perceiv perform of a product over time as boredom creep in with repeat usag. our habitu mechan suppos that habitu build up with repeat us of a product, and is us to discount the perform of the product. in most case i.e. unless the habitu factor is on or extrem close to on, thi habitu-base discount eventu lead to defect, after which the level of  habitu dissip as time pass without the product be us. more formal, onc a product i∗ ha been chosen by agent k, the subject level of perform is perceiv and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distribut as n(0, σ) and hi∗kt is an  decreas function of the number of time period that agent k ha been expos to i∗ . in evalu the perform of a product, agent make us of a satisf framework by compar the perceiv perform of the chosen product with their satisfact threshold Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1. agent k will be satisfi with a product i∗ select in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 decis process in design the mechan by which agent make their choic decis, we allow for the possibl that satisfi agent defect from the product that ar current satisfi them. satisfi agent stai with their current product with probabl pr(stai), with a strategi prohibit satisfi agent from move (e.g. [6]) obtain as a special case when pr(stai) = 1. a defect satisfi agent decid on which product to choos by consid all other product for which it ha inform, either by previou person explor or by referr from other agent. the select of a new  product begin by the agent identifi those product from which he or she expect to gain a satisfactori perform on all attribut i.e. those product for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and select a  product from thi set with select probabl proport to −δik. if no satisfactori product exist (or at least the agent is unawar of ani such product) the agent identifi those product that offer at least a minimum level of ‘accept" perform γ− k . the minimum level of accept is  defin as the maximum deviat from hi or her aspir across all attribut that the agent is will to accept i.e. a product is minim accept if and onli if δik < γ− k . agent then select a product at random from the set of  minim accept product. if the set of minim  accept product is empti, agent select a product from the full set of product b at random. the decis process follow by unsatisfi agent is larg similar to that of defect satisfi agent, with the  except that at the outset of the decis process agent will chose to explor a new product, chosen at random from the set of remain product, with probabl α. with  probabl 1 − α, thei will us a decis process like the on outlin abov for satisfi agent. 3.3 constraint on decis process in some circumst market barrier mai exist that make switch between product more difficult,  particularli where some switch cost ar incur as a result of chang on"s choic of product. when barrier ar present, agent do not switch when thei becom unsatisfi, but rather onli when the perform evalu drop below some critic level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measur the strength of the market barrier. although in thi  paper market barrier do not vari over product or time, it is straightforward to allow thi to occur by allow barrier take the gener form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defect that is appli when the product is  purchas for the first time (e.g. a contractu agreement), Δ is the increas in barrier that ar incur for everi addit time period the product is us for, and β∗ is the maximum possibl barrier, and all three quantiti ar allow to vari over product i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 referr process each agent is assum to be connect to qk < p agent i.e. to give and receiv inform from qk other agent. the network over which word-of-mouth commun  travel is govern by the small-world effect [18], by which  network simultan exhibit a high degre of cluster of agent into ‘commun" and a short averag path length between ani two agent in the network, and preferenti attach [2], by which agent with greater number of exist connect ar more like to receiv new on. thi is easili achiev by build a on-dimension lattic with connect between all agent pair separ by κ or fewer lattic space, and creat a small-world network by choos at random a small fraction r of the connect in the network and move on end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probabl proport to it number of exist connect. thi result in a  distribut of the number of connect possess by each agent i.e. a distribut of qk, that is strongli skew to the right. in fact, if the construct of the network is slightli modifi so that new connect ar ad with preferenti  attach (but no connect ar remov), the distribut of qk follow a power-law distribut, but a distribut with a non-zero probabl of an agent have less than the modal number of connect seem more realist in the context of word-of-mouth commun in market system. when an agent purchas a product, thei inform each of the other agent in their circl with probabl equal to pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propens of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captur the the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 389 extent to which the agent"s most recent experi wa  satisfi or dissatisfi. agent ar thu more like to spread word-of-mouth about product that thei have just  experienc as either veri good or veri bad. if an agent receiv inform on the same product from more than on agent, he or she select the referr of onli on of these agent, with select probabl proport to tt(k∗ , k), the degre to which previou referr from k∗ to k were success i.e. result in satisfi experi for agent k. thu agent have the capac to learn about the qualiti of other agent" referr and us thi inform to accept or block futur referr. in thi paper, we emploi a learn condit in which tt(k∗ , k) is multipli by a factor of 0.1 follow an unsatisfi referr and a factor of 3 follow a satisfi referr. the asymmetri in the weight is similar to that emploi in [16], and is motiv by the fact that an  unsatisfi referr is like to be more reliabl evid that a refer agent k∗ doe not possess the same subject  prefer as agent k than a posit referr is of indic the convers. other referr process ar certainli possibl, for  exampl on integr multipl sourc of word-of-mouth rather than choos onli the most-trust sourc: our main  reason for emploi the process describ abov is  simplic. integr differ sourc consider complic the process of learn about the trustworthi of other, and rais further question about the precis natur of the integr. after determin who contact whom, the actual  referr is model as a transmitt of inform about the perceiv level of perform of an experi of product i∗ from the refer agent k∗ to the accept agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) take on the valu pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provid that agent k is not current us i∗ . inform about other product is not transmit, and an agent will ignor ani word-of-mouth about the product he or she is current us. in effect, the referr creat an expect level of perform in the mind of an accept agent for the product refer to, which that agent mai then us when make choic decis in subsequ time period us the decis process outlin in the previou section. onc an agent ha person experienc a product, ani expect perform level suggest by previou referr ar  replac by the experienc (subject) perform level sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and tt(k∗ , k) is adjust depend on whether the experi wa a satisfi on or not. 4. experiment result we examin the behaviour of a system of 200 agent  consist of three group of 67, 67, and 66 agent respect. agent in each of the three group have homogen  subject opinion function sij. simul were run for 500 time period, and twenti repetit of each condit were us in order to gener aggreg result. 4.1 choic task difficulti we begin by examin the effect of task difficulti on the abil of variou network configur to converg to a state in which an accept proport of the  popul ar satisfi. in the ‘easi" choic condit, there ar 50 product to choos from in the market, evalu over 4 attribut with all satisfact threshold set to 0.5 for all group. there ar therefor on averag approxim 3 product that can be expect to satisfi ani particular agent. in the ‘hard" choic condit, there ar 500  product to choos from in the market, still evalu over 4 attribut but with all satisfact threshold now set to 0.7 for all group, so there ar on averag approxim 4 product that can be expect to satisfi ani particular agent. locat a satisfactori product is therefor far more difficult under the ‘hard" condit. the effect of task  difficulti is evalu on three network structur  correspond to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world  network), and r = 0 (tight ‘commun" of agent), with  result shown in figur 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500

littl over 50 time period, converg to a state in which just less than 60% of agent ar satisfi at ani on time. furthermor, differ network structur have veri littl influenc on result, so that onli a singl (smooth) seri is given for comparison with the ‘hard" condit. clearli, there ar enough agent independ solv the task i.e. 390 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) find a satisfi brand, to make the dissemin of  inform rel independ of the wai in which  connect ar made. howev, when it is more difficult to locat a satisfi product, the structur of the network  becom integr to the speed at which the system converg to a stabl state. importantli, the overal satisfact level to which the system converg remain just below 60%  regardless of which network structur is us, but converg is consider speed by the random rewir of even a small proport of connect. thu while the random network (r = 1) converg quickest, the small-world  network (r = 0.05) also show a substanti improv over the tight commun repres by the on-dimension ring lattic. thi effect of the rewir paramet r is much less pronounc for more highli-connect network (e.g. κ = 9), which suggest that the degre distribut of a  network is a more import determin of system behaviour than the wai in which agent ar connect to on anoth. similar result ar observ when look at the market share achiev by the market lead product under each level of choic difficulti: market share is essenti  independ of network structur for the easi task, with  averag share converg quickli to around 35%. set a more difficult task, the converg of market share to an  approxim long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the  smallworld network, with the random and tight commun  network take differ path but similar time to reach their equilibrium level. also interest is the find that  equilibrium market share for the market leader appear to be slightli (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network  connect ar non-random - the random network seem to suffer more from the effect of habituat than the other network as a result of the rapid earli adopt of the  market lead product. 4.2 market barrier in the remaind of thi paper we focu on the effect of variou form of market barrier on the abil of a system of agent to reach a state of accept satisfact. for  simplic, we concentr on the smaller set of 50 product i.e. the ‘easi" choic task discuss abov, but vari the  number of connect that each agent begin with in order to simultan investig the effect of degre distribut on system behaviour. tabl 1 and 2 show the effect of  differ degre distribut on the equilibrium proport of agent that ar satisfi at ani on time, and the  equilibrium proport of agent switch product (move) in ani on time period, under variou level of market barrier constrain their behaviour. in these two tabl,  equilibrium result have been calcul by averag over time period 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extrem close to equilibrium (tabl 3 and 4 make us of all time period). no wom κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.27 0.44 0.56 0.58 β = 0.05 0.26 0.39 0.50 0.52 β = 0.2 0.14 0.27 0.32 0.34 β = 0.4 0.07 0.17

connect  beyond a small number. the first few connect on make increas the probabl of find a satisfi product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contact), follow by a further increas of roughli 25% to 0.56 for the next four. in contrast, ad a further 12 contact improv rel satisfact level by less than 4%. secondli, word-of-mouth commun continu to plai an import role in  improv the perform of the system even when market barrier ar high. in fact, the role mai even be more  import in constrain condit, sinc the rel gain obtain from word-of-mouth ar greater the higher market barrier ar - just have two contact more than doubl the aggreg satisfact level under the most extrem  barrier (β = 0.4). final, it is clear that the mechan by which barrier reduc satisfact is by restrict movement (reflect in the lower proport of agent move in ani particular column of tabl 1 and 2), but that increas in degre distribut act to increas satisfact by precis the same mechan of reduc movement - thi time by reduc the averag amount of time requir to find a  satisfi brand. posit referr neg referr κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.21 0.93 3.27 0.00 0.00 0.00 β = 0.05 0.19 0.85 2.96 0.06

by market  barrier ar those exert over the market share of lead product. figur 2 show the cumul market share  captur by the top three product in the market over time, for all type of market barrier us differ degre  distribut. again, two comment can be made. firstli, in the absenc of market barrier, a greater proport of the  market is captur by the market lead product when  market ar highli-connect rel to when thei ar  poorlyconnect. thi differ can amount to as much as 15%, and is explain by posit feedback within the more  highlyconnect network that serv to increas the probabl that, onc a set of satisfi product have emerg, on is kept inform about these lead product becaus at least on of on"s contact is us it. secondli, the  rel higher market share enjoi by market leader in highli-connect network is erod by market barrier. in move from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leader collect lose an absolut share of 15% and 10% under the larger degre distribut κ = 9 and κ = 3 respect. the

prevent from switch to anoth product, ar particularli damag to lead product when agent ar well-connect, and that under moder to strong market barrier these effect more than offset ani gain achiev by the spread of posit word-of-mouth through the network. tabl 3 displai the number of attempt referr, both posit and neg, as a function of degre distribut and extent of market barrier, and show that stronger  market barrier act to simultan depress posit  word-ofmouth commun and increas neg  commun from those trap in unsatisfi product  relationship, and that thi effect is particularli pronounc for

behaviour, theori of inform transfer, and adapt behaviour. in thi  paper we have attempt to address some of these issu in a manner which reflect how agent might act in the real world. us the kei notion of a limit commun  network, a simpl learn process, and a satisf heurist that mai be subject to extern constraint, we show (1) the import of word-of-mouth commun to both system effect and stabil, (2) that the degre  distribut of a network is more influenti than the wai in which agent ar connect, but that both ar import in more complex environ, (3) that rewir even a small number of connect to creat a small-world network can have dramat result for the speed of converg to  satisf distribut and market share alloc, (4) that word-of-mouth continu to be effect when movement between product ar constrain by market barrier, and (5) that increas in neg word-of-mouth incur as a result of market barrier can reduc the market share  collect captur by lead brand, but that thi is depend on the exist of a suitabl well-connect network  structur. it is the final find that is like to be most  surpris and practic relev for the market research field, and suggest that it mai not alwai be in the best  interest of a market leader to impos barrier that prevent  custom from leav. in poorli-connect network, the  effect of barrier on market share is slight. in contrast, in well-connect network, neg word-of-mouth can  prevent agent from try a product that thei might  otherwis have found satisfi, and thi can inflict signific harm on market share. product with small market share (which, in the context of our simul, is gener due to the product offer poor perform) ar rel  unaffect by neg word-of-mouth, sinc most product trial ar like to be unsatisfi in ani case. agent-base model provid a natur wai for  begin to investig the type of dynam that occur in  market system. natur the us of result is for the most part depend on the qualiti of the model of the two ‘modul" compris network structur and local  behaviour. on the network side, futur work might investig the relationship between degre distribut, the wai  connect ar creat and destroi over time, whether  preferenti attach is influenti, and the extent to which social ident inform network strucutr, all in larger  network of more heterogen agent. on the behaviour side, on might look at the adapt of satisfact threshold dure the cours of commun, respons to systemat chang in product perform over time, the integr of variou inform sourc, and differ market barrier structur. all these area provid fascin opportun to introduc psycholog realiti into model of  market system and to observ the result behaviour of the system under increasingli realist scenario descript. 6. refer [1] e. anderson.
