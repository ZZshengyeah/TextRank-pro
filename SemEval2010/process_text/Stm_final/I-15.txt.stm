inform search and share in larg-scale dynam network georg a. vouro depart of inform & commun system engin univers of the aegean, samo, greec georgev@aegean.gr abstract find the right agent in a larg and dynam network to provid the need resourc in a time fashion, is a long stand problem. thi paper present a method for inform search and share that combin rout indic with  tokenbas method. the propos method enabl agent to search effect by acquir their neighbor" interest, advertis their inform provis abil and maintain indic for rout queri, in an integr wai. specif, the paper demonstr through perform experi how static and dynam network of agent can be ‘tune" to answer queri effect as thei gather evid for the interest and inform provis abil of other, without alter the topolog or impos an overlai structur to the network of acquaint. categori and subject descriptor i.2.11 [artifici intellig]: distribut artifici intellig  1. introduct consid to be a decentr control problem, inform search and share in larg-scale system of cooper agent is a hard problem in the gener case: the comput of an optim polici, when each agent possess an approxim partial view of the state of the environ and when agent" observ and activ ar interdepend (i.e. on agent"s action affect the observ and the state of an other) [3], is hard. thi fact, ha result to effort that either requir agent to have a global view of the system [15], to heurist [4], to  precomput of agent" inform need and inform provis capabl for proactiv commun [17], to local reason process built on incom inform [12,13,14], and to mathemat framework for coordin whose optim polici can be approxim [11] for small (sub-) network of associ agent. on the other hand, there is a lot of research on semant peer to peer search network and social network [1,5,6,8,9,10,16,18,19] mani of which deal with tune a network of peer for effect inform search and share. thei do it mostli by impos logic and semant overlai structur. howev, as far as we know there is no work that demonstr the effect of a gradual tune process in larg-scale dynam network that studi the impact of the inform gather by agent as more and more queri ar issu and serv in concurr session in the network. the main issu in thi paper concern ‘tune" a network of agent, each with a specif expertis, for effici and effect inform search and share, without alter the topolog or impos an overlai structur via cluster, introduct of shortcut indic, or re-wire. ‘ " is the task of share and gather the knowledg for agent to propag request to the acquaint, minim the search effort, increas the effici and the benefit of the system. specif, thi paper propos a method for inform search and share in dynam and larg scale network, which combin rout indic with token-base method for inform share in larg-scale multi-agent system. thi paper is structur as follow: section 2 present relat work and motiv the propos method. section 3 state the problem and section 4 present in detail the individu techniqu and the overal propos method. section 5 present the experiment setup and result, and section 6 conclud the paper, sketch futur work. 2. relat work inform provis and share can be consid to be a decentr partial-observ markov decis process [3,4,11,14]. in the gener case, decentr control of  largescal dynam system of cooper agent is a hard problem. optim solut can onli be approxim by mean of heurist, by relax of the origin problem or by central solut. the comput of an optim control polici is simpl given that global state can be factor, that the probabl of transit and observ ar independ, the observ combin determin the global state of the system and the reward function can be easili defin as the sum of local reward function [3]. howev, in a larg-scale dynam system with decentr control it is veri hard for agent to possess accur partial view of the environ, and it is even more hard for agent to possess a global view of the environ. furthermor, agent" observ can not be assum independ, as on agent"s action can affect the observ of other: for instanc, when on agent join/leav the system, then thi mai affect other agent" assess of neighbour" inform provis abil. furthermor, the probabl of transit can be depend too; someth that increas the complex of the problem: for exampl, when an agent send a queri to anoth agent, then thi mai affect the state of the latter, as far as the assess interest of the former ar concern. consid independ activ and observ, author in [4] propos a decis-theoret solut treat standard action and inform exchang as explicit choic that the decis maker must make. thei approxim the solut us a myopic algorithm. their work differ in the on report here in the follow aspect: first, it aim at optim commun, while the goal here is to tune the network for effect inform share, reduc commun and increas system"s benefit. second, the solut is approxim us a myopic algorithm, but author do not demonstr how  suboptim ar the solut comput (someth we neither do), given their interest to the optim solut. third, thei consid that transit and observ made by agent ar independ, which, as alreadi discuss, is not true in the gener case. last, in contrast to their approach where agent broadcast messag, here agent decid not onli when to commun, but to whom to send a messag too. token base approach ar promis for scale coordin and therefor inform provis and share to larg-scale system effect. in [11] author provid a mathemat framework for rout token, provid also an approxim to solv the origin problem in case of independ agent" activ. the propos method requir a high volum of comput that author aim to reduc by restrict it applic to static logic team of associ agent. in accord to thi approach, in [12,13,14], inform share is consid onli for static network and self-tune of network is not demonstr. as it will be shown in section 5, our experi show that although these approach can handl inform share in dynam network, thei requir a larger amount of messag in comparison to the approach propos here and can not tune the network for effici inform share. proactiv commun ha been propos in [17] as a result of a dynam decis theoret determin of commun strategi. thi approach is base on the specif of agent as provid and needer: thi is done by a plan-base  precomput of inform need and provis abil of agent. howev, thi approach can not scale to larg and dynam network, as it would be highli ineffici for each agent to comput and determin it potenti need and inform provis abil given it potenti interact with 100s of other agent. view inform retriev in peer-to-peer system from a multi-agent system perspect, the approach propos in [18] is base on a languag model of agent" document collect. exploit the model of other agent in the network, agent construct their view of the network which is be us for form rout decis. initi, agent build their view us the model of their neighbour. then, the system reorgan by form cluster of agent with similar content. cluster ar be exploit dure inform retriev us a knn approach and a gradient search scheme. although thi work aim at tune a network for effici inform provis (through  reorgan), it doe not demonstr the effect of the approach with respect to thi issu. moreov, although dure  reorgan and retriev thei measur the similar of content between agent, a more fine grain approach is need that would allow agent to measur similar of inform item or sub-collect of inform item. howev, it is expect that thi will complic re-organ. base on their work on peer-to-peer system, h.zhand and v.lesser in [19] studi concurr search session. deal with static network, thei focu on minim process and commun bottleneck: although we deal with concurr search session, their work is orthogon to our, which mai be further extend toward incorpor such featur in the futur. consid research in semant peer-to-peer system1 , most of the approach exploit what can be loos state a rout index. a major question concern inform search is what inform ha to be share between peer, when, and what adjust have to be made so as queri to be rout to trustworthi inform sourc in the most effect and effici wai. remindin" [10] peer gather inform concern the queri that have been answer successfulli by other peer, so as to subsequ select peer to forward request to: thi is a lazi learn approach that doe not involv advertis of peer inform provis abil. thi result in a tune process where the overal recal increas over time, while the number of messag per queri remain about the same. here, agent activ advertis their inform provis abil base on the assess interest of their peer: thi result in a much lower number of messag per queri than those report in remindin". in [5,6] peer, us a common ontolog, advertis their expertis, which is be exploit for the format of a semant overlai network: queri ar propag in thi network depend on their similar with peer" expertis. it is on the receiv"s side to decid whether it shall accept or not an advertis, base on the similar between expertis descript. accord to our approach, agent advertis select their inform provis abil about specif topic to their neighbour with similar inform interest (and onli to these). howev, thi is done as time pass and while agent" receiv request from their peer. the gradual creation of overlai network via re-wire, shortcut creation [1,8,16] or cluster of peer [17,9] ar tune approach that differ fundament from the on propos here: through local interact, we aim at tune the network for effici inform provis by gather rout inform gradual, as queri ar be propag in the network and 1 gener research in peer-to-peer system concentr either on network topolog or on distribut of document: approach do not aim to optim advertis, and search mostli requir common kei for node and their content. thei gener a substanti overhead in highli dynam set, where node join/leav the system. 248 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) agent advertis their inform provis abil given the interest of their neighbour. given the success of thi method, we shall studi how the addit of logic path and gradual evolut of the network topolog can further increas the effect of the propos method. 3. problem statement let { } be the set of agent in the system. the network of agent is model as a graph =( , ), where is the set of agent and is a set of bidirect edg denot as  nonord pair ( , ). the neighbourhood of an agent includ all the on-hop awai agent (i.e. it acquaint agent) such that ( ) the set of acquaint of is denot by each agent maintain (a) an ontolog that repres categori of inform, (b) indic of inform piec avail to it local databas and to other agent, and (c) a profil model for some of it acquaint. indic and profil model ar describ in detail in section 4. ontolog concept repres categori that classifi the inform piec avail. it is assum that agent in the network share the same ontolog, but each agent ha a set of inform item in it local repositori, which ar classifi under the concept of it expertis. the set of concept is denot by it is assum that the set of item in agent" local repositori ar non-overlap. final, it is assum that there is a set of queri . each queri is repres by a tupl where is the uniqu ident of the queri is a non-neg integ repres the maximum number of inform piec request, is the specif categori to which these piec must belong, is a path in the network of agent through which the queri ha been propag (initi it contain the origin of the queri and each agent append it id in the befor propag the queri), and is a posit integ that specifi the maximum number of hop that the queri can reach. in case thi limit is exceed and the correspond number of inform piec have not been found, then the queri is consid unfulfil howev, even in thi case, a (possibl high) percentag of the request piec of inform mai have been found. the problem that thi articl deal with is as follow: given a network of agent and a set of queri , agent must retriev the piec of inform request by queri, in concurr search session, and further ‘tune" the network so as to answer futur similar queri in the more effect and effici wai, increas the benefit of the system and reduc the commun messag requir. the of the system is the ratio of inform piec retriev to the number of inform piec request. the of the system is measur by the number of messag need for search and updat the index and profil maintain. ‘tune" the network requir agent to acquir the necessari inform about acquaint" interest and inform provis abil (i.e. the rout and profil tupl detail in section 4), so as to rout queri and further share inform in the most effici wai. thi must be done seamlessli to search: i.e. agent in the network must share/acquir the necessari inform while search, increas the benefit and effici gradual, as more queri ar pose. 4. inform search and share 4.1 overal method given a network =( , ) of agent and a set of queri , each agent maintain indic for rout queri to the right agent, as well as acquaint" profil for advertis it inform provis abil to those interest. to captur inform about piec of inform access by the agent, each agent maintain a rout index that is realiz as a set of tupl of the form < , , >. each such tupl specifi the number of inform item in categori that can be reach by , such that ( ) { }. thi specifi the of to with respect to the inform categori . as it can be notic, each tupl correspond either to the agent itself (specifi the piec of inform classifi in avail to it local repositori) or to an acquaint of the agent (record the piec of inform in categori avail to the acquaint agent and to agent that can be reach through thi acquaint). the rout index is exploit for the propag of queri to the right agent: those that ar either more like to provid answer or that know someon that can provid the request piec of inform. consid an agent , the profil model of some of it acquaint , denot by is a set of tupl < , >, maintain by . such a tupl specifi the probabl that the acquaint is interest to piec of inform in categori subsequ, such a probabl is also denot by ). formal, the profil model of an acquaint of is { , >| ( ) and }. profil model ar exploit by the agent to decid where to ‘advertis" their inform provis abil. given two acquaint and in , the inform search and share process proce as it is depict in figur 1: initi, each agent ha no knowledg about the inform provis abil of it acquaint and also, it possess no inform about their interest. when that the queri is sent to from the agent , then ha to updat the profil of concern the categori increas the probabl that is interest to inform in when thi probabl is greater than a threshold valu (due to the queri about that ha sent to ), then assess that it is highli figur 1. typic pattern for inform share between two acquaint (number show the sequenc of task) aj ai the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 249 probabl for to be interest about inform in categori . thi lead to inform about it inform provis abil as far as the categori is concern. thi inform is be us by to updat it index about . thi index is be exploit by to further propag queri, and it is further propag to those interest in . moreov, the profil of maintain by guid to propag chang concern it inform provis abil to . the abov method ha the follow featur: (a) it combin rout indic and token-base inform share techniqu for effici inform search and share, without impos an overlai network structur. (b) it can be us by agent to adapt safe and effect to dynam network. (c) it support the acquisit and exploit of differ type of local avail inform for the ‘tune" process. (d) it extend the  tokenbas method for inform share (as it wa origin propos in [12,13]) in two respect: first, to deal with categori of inform repres by mean of ontolog concept and not with specif piec of inform, and second, to guid agent to advertis inform that is semant similar to the inform request, by us a semant similar measur between inform categori. therefor, it pave the wai for the us of token-base method for semant peer-to-peer system. thi is further describ in section 4.3. (d) it provid a more sophist wai for agent to updat rout indic than that origin propos in [2]. thi is done by gather and exploit acquaint" profil for effect inform share, avoid unnecessari and cyclic updat that mai result to mislead inform about agent" inform provis abil. thi is further describ in the next sub-section. 4.2 rout indic as alreadi specifi, given a network of agent and the set of agent"s acquaint, the rout index (ri) of (denot by ) is a collect of at most | | index tupl < , >. the kei idea is that given such an index and a request concern , will forward thi request to if the resourc avail (i.e. the inform abil of to ) can best serv thi request. to comput the inform abil of to , all tupl < , > concern all agent in ( )-{ } must be aggreg. crespo and garcia-molina [2] examin variou type of aggreg. in thi paper, given some tupl < >,< , …> maintain by the agent , their aggreg is the tupl < , >. thi give inform concern the piec of inform that can be provid through , but it doe not distinguish what each of "s acquaint can provid: thi is an inher featur of rout indic. without consid the interest of it acquaint, mai comput aggreg concern agent in ( ) { }-{ } and advertis/share it inform provis abil to each agent in ( ). for instanc, given the network configur depict in figur 2 and a categori , agent send the aggreg of the tupl concern agent in ( ) { }-{ } (denot as ( , )) to agent , which record the tupl < >. similarli the aggreg of the tupl concern the agent in ( ) { }-{ } (denot as ( )) is sent to the agent , which also record the tupl < >. it must be notic that and record the inform provis abil of each from it own point of view. everi time the tupl that model the inform provis abil of an agent chang, the aggreg ha to re-comput and send the new aggreg to the appropri neighbor in the wai describ abov. then, it neighbor have to propag these updat to their acquaint, and so on. figur 2.aggreg and share inform provis indic. rout indic mai be mislead and lead to ineffici in arbitrari graph contain cycl. the exploit of acquaint" profil can provid solut to these defici. each agent propag it inform provis abil concern a categori onli to these acquaint that have high interest in thi categori. as it ha been mention, an agent express it interest in a categori by propag queri about it. therefor, indic concern a categori ar propag in the invers direct in the path to which queri about ar propag. indic ar propag as long as agent in the path have a high interest in . queri can not be propag in a cyclic fashion sinc an agent serv and propag queri that have not been serv by it in a previou time point. therefor, due to their relat to queri, indic ar not propag in a cyclic fashion, as well. howev, there is still a specif case where cycl can not be avoid. such a case is shown in figur 3: figur 3. cyclic pattern for the share of indic. while the propag of the queri caus the propag of inform provis abil of agent in a non cyclic wai (sinc the agent a recogn that ha been serv), the queri caus the propag of inform abil of a to other agent in the network, caus, in conjunct to the propag of indic due to a cyclic updat of indic. 4.3 profil the kei assumpt behind the exploit of acquaint" profil, as it wa origin propos in [12,13], is that for an agent to pass a specif inform item, thi agent ha a high interest on it or to relat inform. as alreadi said, in our case, acquaint" profil ar creat base on receiv queri and specifi the interest of acquaint to specif inform categori. given the queri sent from to , ha to record not onli the interest of to , but ak a2 a notat acquaint relat flow of queri flow of indic due to flow of queri flow of indic due to 250 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) the interest of to all the relat class, given their semant similar to to measur the similar between two ontolog class we us the similar function [0,1] [7]: = otherwis cc 01.0 1 cofsubconceptaiscif ji ji where is the length of the shortest path between and in the graph span by the sub concept relat and the minim level in the hierarchi of either or . and ar paramet scale the contribut of shortest path length and , respect. base on previou work we choos =0.2 and =0.6 as optim valu. it must be notic that we measur similar between sub-concept, assign a veri low similar valu between concept that ar not relat by the sub-concept relat. thi is due to that, each queri about inform in categori can be answer by inform in ani sub-categori of close enough to given a threshold valu 0.3, 0.3 indic that an agent interest in is also interest in , while <0.3 indic that an agent interest in is unlik to be interest in . thi threshold valu wa chosen after some empir experi with ontolog. the updat of "s assess on pc base on an incom queri from is comput by leverag bay rule as follow [12,13]: , and ( ) if is the last in the || 1 || 2 ),( if is not the last in the then probabl must be normal to ensur that , 1 )( , accord to the first case of the equat, the probabl that the agent that ha propag a queri about to be interest about inform in , is updat base on the similar between and . the second case updat the interest of agent other than the request on, in a wai that ensur that normal work. it must be notic that in contrast to [12,13], the comput ha been chang in favour to the agent that pass the queri. the profil of acquaint enabl an agent to decid where and which advertis to be sent. specif, for each and for which is greater than a threshold valu (current set to 0.5), the agent aggreg the vector ( ) of each agent ( ) { }-{ }and send the tupl ( , ) to . also, given a high , when a chang to an index concern occur (e.g. due to a chang in "s local repositori, or due to that the set of it acquaint chang), send the updat aggreg index entri to . do so, the agent which is highli interest to piec of inform in categori updat it index so as to becom awar of the inform provis abil of as far as the categori is concern. 4.4 tune tune is perform seamlessli to search: as agent propag queri to be serv, their profil ar get updat by their acquaint. as their profil ar get updat, agent receiv the aggreg indic of their acquaint, becom awar of their inform provis abil on inform categori to which thei ar probabl interest. given these indic, agent further propag queri to acquaint that ar more like to serv queri, and so on. concern the rout index and the profil maintain by an agent , it must be point that doe not need to record all possibl tupl, i.e. | | | { }|: it record onli those that ar of particular interest for search and share inform, depend on the expertis and interest of it own and it acquaint. initi, agent do not possess profil of their acquaint. for indic there ar two altern: either agent do not initi possess ani inform about acquaint" local repositori (thi is the   case), or thei do (thi is the   case). given a queri, agent propag thi queri to those acquaint that have the highest inform provis abil. in the no initi of indic case where an agent doe not initi possess inform about it acquaint" abil, it mai initi propag a queri to all of them, result to a pure flood approach; or it mai propag the queri randomli to a percentag of them. in the initi of indic case, where an agent initi possess inform about it acquaint" local repositori, it can propag queri to all or to a percentag of those that can best serv the request. we consid both case in our experi. given a static set where agent do not shift their expertis, and the distribut of inform piec doe not chang, the network will eventu reach a state where no inform concern agent" inform abil will need to be propag and no agent" profil will need to be updat: queri shall be propag onli to those agent that will lead to a near-to-the-maximum benefit of the system in a veri effici wai. in a dynam set, agent mai shift their expertis, their interest, thei mai leav the network at will, or welcom new agent that join the network and bring new inform provis abil, new interest and new type of queri. in thi paper we studi set where agent mai leav or join the network. thi requir agent to adapt safe and effect. toward thi goal, in case an agent doe not receiv a repli from on of it acquaint within a time interv, then it retract all the indic and the profil concern the miss acquaint and  repropag the queri that have been sent to the miss agent sinc the last success handshak, to other agent. in case a new agent join the network, then it acquaint that ar get awar of it presenc propag all the queri that have process by them in the last time point (current is set to 6) to the newcom. thi is done so as to inform the newcom about their interest and initi inform share. 5. experiment setup to valid the propos approach we have built a prototyp that simul larg network. to test the scalabl of our approach the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 251 we have run sever experi with variou type of network. here we present result from 3 network type with | |=100, | |=500 and | |=1000 that provid repres case. network ar construct by distribut randomli | | agent in an area, each with a visibl ratio equal to the acquaint of an agent ar those that ar visibl to the agent and those from which the agent is visibl (sinc edg in the network ar  bidirect). detail about network ar given in tabl 1. the column avg(|n(a)|) show the averag number of acquaint per agent in the network and the column |t| show the number of queri per network type. it must be notic that the typea network is more dens than the other, which ar much larger than thi. each experi ran 40 time. in each run the network is provid with a new set of randomli gener queri that ar origin from randomli chosen agent. the agent search and gather knowledg that thei further us and enrich, tune the network gradual, run by run. each run last a number of round that depend on the of queri and on the paramet that determin the dynam of the network: to end a run, all queri must have either been serv (i.e. 100% of the inform item request must have been found), or thei must have been unfulfil (i.e. have exceed their ). it must be notic that in case of a dynam set, thi end criterion caus some of the queri to be lost. thi is the case when some queri ar the onli activ remain and the agent to whom thei have been propag left the network without their acquaint to be awar of it. tabl1: network type |n| r n avg(|n(a)|) |t| typea 100 10 25 50 363 typeb 500 10 125 20 1690 typec 1000 10 250 10 3330 inform us in the experi is synthet and is be classifi in 15 distinct categori: each agent"s expertis compris a uniqu inform categori. for the categori in it expertis each agent hold at most 1000 inform piec, the exact number of which is determin randomli. at each run a constant number of queri ar be gener, depend on the type of network us (last column in tabl 1). at each run, each queri is randomli assign to an origin agent and is set to request a random number of inform item, classifi in a sub-categori of the queri-origin agent"s expertis. thi sub-categori is chosen in a random wai and the request item ar less than 6000. the for ani queri is set to be equal to 6. in such a set, the demand for inform item is much higher than the agent" inform provis abil, given the of queri: the maximum benefit in ani experiment case is much less than 60% (thi ha been done so as to challeng the ‘tune" task in set where queri can not be serv in the first hop or after 2-3 hop). given that agent ar initi not awar of acquaint" local repositori (  case), we have run sever evalu experi for each network type depend on the percentag of acquaint to which a queri can be propag by an agent. these type of experi ar denot by typex-y, where x denot the type of network and y the percentag of acquaint: here we present result for y equal to 10, 20 or 50. for instanc, typea-10 denot a set with a 0 50 100 150 200

provid to the number of piec request per queri, and the i.e. the ratio of benefit to the total number of messag. the horizont axi in each diagram correspond to the run. as it is shown in figur 4, as agent search and share inform from run 1 to run 40, thei manag to increas the benefit of the system, by drastic reduc the number of messag. also (not shown here due to space reason) the number of unfulfil queri decreas, while the serv queri increas gradual. experi show: (a) an effect tune of the network as time pass and more queri ar pose to the network, even if agent maintain the model of a small percentag of their acquaint. (b) that ‘tune" can greatli facilit the scalabl of the inform search and share task in network. to show whether initi knowledg about acquaint local repositori (the   case) affect the effect tune of the network, we provid repres result from the typeb-20 network. as it is shown in figur 4, the tune task in thi case doe not manag to achiev the benefit of the system report for the   case. on the contrari, while the tune affect the drastic; the ar not affect in the same wai: the in the  case ar less than those in the typeb-20 with   case. thi is further shown in a more clear wai in the messag gain of both approach: the messag gain of the typeb-20 with   case is higher than the messag gain for the typeb-20 experi with  . therefor, initi knowledg concern local inform of acquaint can be us for guid search and tune at the initi stage of the tune task, onli if we need to gain effici (i.e. decreas the number of requir messag) to the cost of loos effect (i.e. have lower benefit): thi is due to the fact that, as agent poss inform about acquaint" local repositori, the tune process enabl the further exchang of messag concern agent" inform provis abil in case where agent" profil provid evid for such a need. howev, initi inform about acquaint" local repositori mai mislead the search process, result in low benefit. in case we need to gain effect to the cost of reduc effici, thi type of local knowledg doe not suffic. consid also the inform share method without rout indic ( case), we can see that for static network it requir more without manag to tune the system, while the benefit is nearli the same to the on report by our method. thi is shown clearli in the messag gain diagram in figur 4. figur 5 provid result for dynam network. these ar result from a particular repres case of our experi where more than 25% of (randomli chosen) node leav the network in each run dure the experi. after a random number of i-messag per run q-messag per run benefit per run messag gain per run the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 253 round, a new node mai replac the on left. thi newcom ha no inform about the network. approxim 25% of the node that leav the network ar not replac for 50% of the experi, and approxim 50% ar not replac for more than 35% of the experi. in such a highli dynam set with veri scarc inform resourc distribut in the network, as figur 5 show, the tune approach ha manag to keep the benefit to accept level, while still reduc drastic the number of i-messag. howev, as it can be expect, thi reduct is not so drastic as it wa in the correspond static case. figur 5 show that the messag gain for the dynam case is compar to the messag gain for the correspond  (typec50) static case, which prove the valu of thi approach for dynam set. the comparison to the case where no rout indic ar exploit reveal the same result as in the static case, to the cost of a larg number of messag. final it must be point that the maximum number of messag per queri requir by the propos method is nearli 12, which is less than that that report by other effort. 6. conclus thi paper present a method for semant queri process in larg network of agent that combin rout indic with inform share method. the present method enabl agent to keep record of acquaint" interest, to advertis their inform provis abil to those that have a high interest on them, and to maintain indic for rout queri to those agent that have the request inform provis abil. specif, the paper demonstr through extens perform experi: (a) how network of agent can be ‘tune" so as to provid request inform effect, increas the benefit and the effici of the system. (b) how differ type of local knowledg (number, local inform repositori, percentag, interest and inform provis abil of acquaint) can guid agent to effect answer queri, balanc between effici and efficaci. (c) that the propos tune task manag to increas the effici of inform search and share in highli dynam and larg network. (d) that the inform gather and maintain by agent support effici and effect inform search and share: initi inform about acquaint inform provis abil is not necessari and a small percentag of acquaint suffic. further work concern experi with real data and ontolog, differ in ontolog between agent, shift in expertis and the parallel construct of overlai structur. 7. refer [1] cooper, b.f., garcia-molina, h. ad-hoc, self-supervis peer-to-peer search network. , volum 23 ,issu 2 (april 2005) ,169 - 200 [2] crespo, a., garcia-molina, h. rout indic for  peer-topeer system, in , juli 2002.", [3] goldman, c., and zilberstein, s. decentr control of cooper system: categor and complex analysi. 22 (2004), 143-174.
