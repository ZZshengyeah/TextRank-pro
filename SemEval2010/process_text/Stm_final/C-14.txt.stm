for the emerg of sensor network capabl of observ the environ, process the data and make decis base on the observ. such a network can be us to monitor the environ, detect, classifi and  locat specif event, and track target over a specif region. exampl of such system ar in surveil, monitor of pollut, traffic, agricultur or civil infrastructur [6]. the deploy of sensor network vari with the applic consid. it can be predetermin when the environ is suffici known and under control, in which case the sensor can be strateg hand place. the deploy can also be a priori undetermin when the environ is unknown or hostil in which case the sensor mai be  airdrop from an aircraft or deploi by other mean,  gener result in a random placement. thi paper investig deploy strategi for sensor network perform target detect over a region of  interest. in order to detect a target move through the region, sensor have to make local observ of the environ and collabor to produc a global decis that reflect the statu of the region cover [2]. thi collabor requir local process of the observ, commun between differ node, and inform fusion [7]. sinc the local observ made by the sensor depend on their posit, the perform of the detect algorithm is a function of the deploy. on possibl measur of the good of deploy for target detect is call path exposur. it is a measur of the likelihood of detect a target travers the region us a given path. the higher the path  exposur, the better the deploy. the set of path to be consid mai be constrain by the environ. for  exampl, if the target is expect to be follow a road, onli the path consist of the road need to be consid. in thi studi, the deploy is assum to be random which correspond to mani practic applic where the region to be monitor is not access for precis  placement of sensor. the focu of thi paper is to determin the number of sensor to be deploi to carri out target  detect in a region of interest. the tradeoff lie between the network perform, the cost of the sensor deploi, and the cost of deploi the sensor. thi paper is organ as follow. in section 2, a definit for path exposur is propos and a method to evalu the exposur of a given path is develop. in section 3, the problem of random  deploy is formul and sever solut ar present. an analyt studi of these solut is given in section 4 and section 5 present simul result that ar us in section 6 to determin the optimum solut for a given  environ. the paper conclud with section 7. 2. path exposur in thi section, a model for sensor network target detect is propos, a definit of path exposur is present and express for evalu thi path exposur ar develop. 2.1 model consid a rectangular sensor field with n sensor  de42 ploi at locat si, i = 1, . . . , n. a target at locat u emit a signal which is measur by the sensor. the  signal from the target decai as a polynomi of the distanc. if the decai coeffici is k, the signal energi of a target at locat u measur by the sensor at si is given by si(u) = k ||u − si||k (1) where k is the energi emit by the target and ||u − si|| is the geometr distanc between the target and the sensor. depend on the environ the valu k typic rang from 2.0 to 5.0 [4]. energi measur at a sensor ar usual corrupt by nois. if ni denot the nois energi at sensor i dure a particular measur, then the total energi measur at sensor i, when the target is at locat u, is ei(u) = si(u) + ni = k ||u − si||k + ni. the sensor collabor to arriv at a consensu decis as to whether a target is present in the region. we consid two basic approach for reach thi consensu: valu fusion and decis fusion [3]. in valu fusion, on of the sensor gather the energi measur from the other sensor, total up the energi and compar the sum to a threshold to decid whether a target is present. if the sum exce the threshold, then the consensu decis is that a target is present. in contrast, in decis fusion, each individu sensor compar it energi measur to a threshold to arriv at a local decis as to whether a target is present. the local decis (1 for target present and 0 otherwis) from the sensor ar total at a sensor and the sum is  compar to anoth threshold to arriv at the consensu  decis. in some situat, valu fusion outperform decis fusion and vice versa. 2.1.1 valu fusion. the probabl of consensu target detect when the target is at locat u is dv(u) = prob n i=1 k ||u − si||k + ni ≥ η = prob n i=1 ni ≥ η − n i=1 k ||u − si||k , where η is the valu fusion threshold. if the nois process at the sensor ar independ, then the probabl densiti function of n i=1 ni equal the convolut of the  probabl densiti function of ni, i = 1, . . . , n. in particular, if the nois process at each sensor is addit white gaussian nois (awgn), then n i=1 ni ha a chi-squar distribut of degre n. due to the presenc of nois, the sensor mai incorrectli decid that a target is present even though there is no  target in the field. the probabl of a consensu fals target detect is fv = prob n i=1 ni ≥ η . (2) as abov, if the nois process at the sensor ar  independ and awgn, then the fals alarm probabl can be comput from the chi-squar distribut of degre n. 2.1.2 decis fusion. for decis fusion, the probabl of consensu target detect when the target is locat at u is dd(u) = prob n i=1 hd,i(u) ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · p1 j · p0 (n−j) where p1 = prob [hd,i(u) = 1] = prob ni ≥ η1 − k ||u − si||k and p0 = prob [hd,i(u) = 0] = 1 − prob [hd,i(u) = 1] . can be comput from chi-squar distribut of degre 1 for awgn nois process. the probabl of fals target detect at sensor i is prob[gd,i = 1] = prob[ni ≥ η1] and prob[gd,i = 0] = 1 − prob[gd,i = 1]. therefor, the probabl of consensu fals target detect is fd = prob n i=1 gd,i ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · (prob [gd,i = 1])j · (prob [gd,i = 0])(n−j) the abov equat serv as an analyt basi for  evalu exposur as defin in the follow subsect. note that in valu and decis fusion the knowledg of the sensor locat can be us to make the detect decis. for exampl, a sensor can report valu that differ  substanti from it neighbor valu. thi discrep can be analyz to avoid fals alarm or miss and therefor  improv the detect perform. howev, such algorithm ar not consid in thi paper. 2.2 de£nition of exposur we defin exposur to be the probabl of detect the target or an intrud carri out the unauthor activ, where the activ depend on the problem under  consider. in thi paper, the activ consid is the  unauthor travers (ut) as defin below. unauthor travers (ut) problem: we ar given a sensor field with n sensor at locat s1, s2, . . . , sn (see figur 1). we ar also given the stochast character of the nois at each sensor and a toler bound, α, on the fals alarm probabl. let p denot a path from the west to the east peripheri of the sensor field. a target travers the sensor field us path p is detect if it is detect at some point u ∈ p. the exposur of path p is the net probabl of detect a target that travers the field us p. the target is assum to be abl to follow ani path through the field and the problem is to find the path p with the least exposur. 43 sensor figur 1: exampl sensor field for ut problem. 2.3 solut to the ut problem let p denot a path from the west to the east  peripheri through the sensor field. a target that travers the field us p is not detect if and onli if it is not detect at ani time while it is on that path. sinc detect  attempt by the sensor network occur at a fix frequenc, we can associ each detect attempt with a point u ∈ p when assum that the target travers the field at a  constant speed. the detect attempt ar base on energi measur over a period of time t dure which the target is move. therefor, the detect probabl associ with each point u reflect the measur perform  dure time t. consid the path, the net probabl of not detect a target travers the field us p is the  product of the probabl of no detect at each point u ∈ p. that is, if g(p) denot the net probabl of not detect a target as it travers over path p, then, log g(p) = u∈p log(1 − d(u))du, where d(u) is either dv(u) of dd(u) depend on whether the sensor us valu or decis fusion to arriv at a  consensu decis. sinc the exposur of p is (1 − g(p)), the problem is to find the path which minim (1 − g(p)) or equival the path that minim | log g(p)|1 . in gener, the path p that minim | log g(p)| can be fairli arbitrari in shape. the propos solut doe not exactli comput thi path. instead, we reli on the follow approxim. we first divid the sensor field into a fine grid and then assum that the target onli move along thi grid. the problem then is to find the path p on thi grid that minim | log g(p)|. note that, the finer the grid the closer the approxim. also, on can us higher order grid such as in [5] instead of the rectangular grid we us in thi paper. the higher order grid chang the runtim of the algorithm but the approach is the same as with the rectangular grid. for the target not to be detect at ani point u ∈ p, 1 note that, g(p) li between 0 and 1 and thu log g(p) is neg. 1. gener a suitabl fine rectangular grid. 2. for each line segment l between adjac grid point 3. comput | log ml| us equat 3 4. assign l a weight equal to | log ml| 5. endfor 6. add a link from virtual point a to each grid point on the west 7. add a link from virtual point b to each grid point on the east 8. assign a weight of 0 to all the line segment from a and b 9. comput the least weight path p from a to b us dijkstra"s algorithm 10. let w equal the total weight of p. 11. return p as the least exposur path with an exposur equal to 10−w . figur 2: pseudo-code of the propos solut for the ut problem. it need not be detect at ani point u ly between ani two adjac grid point of p. we therefor subdivid ani path p as a chain of grid segment. let us consid two adjac point, sai v1 and v2 on the grid. let l denot the line segment between v1 and v2. also, let ml denot the probabl of not detect a target travel between v1 and v2 on the line segment l. then, from the discuss abov, log ml = u∈l log(1 − d(u))du (3) the probabl ml can be evalu by find the detect probabl d(u) at each point u ∈ l. note that, ml li between 0 and 1 and, therefor, log ml is neg. to find the least expos path, a non-neg weight equal to | log ml| is assign to each segment l on thi grid. also, a fictiti point a is creat and a line segment is ad from a to each grid point on the west peripheri of the sensor field. a weight equal to 0 is assign to each of these line segment. similarli, a fictiti point b is creat and a line segment is ad from b to each grid point on the east peripheri of the sensor field. a weight equal to 0 is assign to each of these line segment. the problem of find the least expos path from west peripheri to east peripheri is then equival to the problem of find the least weight path from a to b on thi grid. such a path can be effici determin us the dijkstra"s shortest path algorithm [1]. a pseudo-code of the overal algorithm is shown in figur 2. exampl: figur 3 show a sensor field with eight sensor at locat mark by dark circl. assum the nois  process at each sensor is addit white gaussian with mean 0 and varianc 1. further assum that the sensor us valu fusion to arriv at a consensu decis. then, from  equat 2, we chose a threshold η = 3.0 to achiev a fals alarm probabl of 0.187%. the field ha been divid into a 10 × 10 grid. the target emit an energi k = 12 and the energi decai factor is 2. the figur show the weight  assign to each line segment in the grid as describ abov. the least exposur path found by the dijkstra"s algorithm for thi weight grid is highlight. the probabl of  de44 fictiti fictiti threshold = 3.0, detect probabl of the path = 0.926 point a point b0.090.921.651.610.860.08 0.860.355.1744.9 0.03 0.800.821.3640.5

figur 3: illustr of the propos solut for an exampl ut problem. tect the target travers the field us the highlight path is 0.926. 3. deploy in thi section, the problem of sensor deploy for  unauthor travers detect is formul and solut ar identifi. 3.1 problem formul consid a region to be monitor for unauthor  travers us a sensor network. the target to travers the sensor field emit a given energi level k and the stochast of the nois in the region is known. the sensor ar to be deploi over the region in a random fashion where the sensor  locat in the region ar a priori undetermin and onli the number or densiti of sensor can be chosen. the problem is to find a deploy strategi that result in a desir  perform level in unauthor travers monitor of the region. thi perform is measur by the fals alarm  probabl and the path exposur defin in section 2. the fals alarm probabl doe not depend on the sensor placement and is onli determin by the number of sensor deploi and the threshold us in the detect algorithm. it is  assum to be fix in thi studi so that the problem consist of maxim the exposur at constant fals alarm rate. sinc target can travers the region through ani path, the goal of deploy is to maxim the exposur of the least expos path in the region. obvious, the minimum exposur in the region increas (if fals alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensor ar deploi in the region. howev, sinc the deploy is random, there ar no guarante that the desir exposur level is achiev for a given number of sensor. inde some sensor placement can result in veri poor detect abil, in particular when the sensor ar all deploi in the same vicin. a studi of the statist distribut of exposur for vari sensor placement for a given number of sensor can provid a confid level that the desir detect level is achiev. in practic situat, onli a limit number of sensor ar avail for deploy and onli a limit detect level with associ confid level is achiev at a given fals alarm rate. 3.2 solut base on the abov discuss, we develop a solut method to the deploy problem when a maximum of m sensor can be us. deploi the m sensor result in the  maximum achiev detect level but is not optim when consid the cost of sensor. to reduc the number of sensor deploi, onli part of the avail sensor can be deploi first and the sensor can then report their posit. the random sensor placement obtain can be analyz to determin if it satisfi the desir perform level. if it doe not, addit sensor can be deploi until the  desir exposur level is reach or until the all m avail sensor ar deploi. the number of sensor us in thi strategi can be  minim by deploi on sensor at a time. howev, a cost is usual associ with each deploy of sensor and  deploi on sensor at a time mai not be cost effect if the cost of deploy is suffici larg with respect to the cost of singl sensor. by assign a cost to both singl  sensor and deploy, the optim number of sensor to be deploi at first and thereaft can be determin. in the next section, we develop analyt express for find the optim solut. in gener, the optim cost solut is neither deploi on sensor at a time nor deploi all the sensor at a time. 4. analyt solut in thi section, we deriv an analyt model for the cost of deploy. let ed be the desir minimum exposur for the sensor network to be deploi when a maximum of m sensor ar avail for deploy. the posit of sensor ar random

n sensor ar deploi. as mention in the previou section, there is no a priori guarante that the exposur ed will be obtain when  deploi the sensor. if m is the maximum number of sensor avail, the confid of obtain a least exposur of ed or more is 1−fm (ed). for the propos solut, we assum that the posit of the sensor obtain after a deploy is known so that addit sensor can be deploi if the minimum exposur ed is not reach. to evalu the  probabl that the exposur ed is reach after addit sensor deploy, we make the follow approxim: the  distribut of exposur for n sensor is independ of the  exposur correspond to k of these n sensor, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. thi is an approxim sinc the exposur obtain with n sensor is alwai higher than the exposur obtain with onli k of these n sensor, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. we observ that the re-deploy of just a few sensor can  substanti modifi the coverag of the region, for exampl when fill empti space. the approxim is also justifi by the loos relat between exposur and sensor posit. inde, a given minimum exposur can correspond to mani differ deploy posit, some of which can be easili improv by deploi a few addit sensor (e.g. when there is a empti space in the region coverag), some of which can onli be improv by deploi mani addit sensor (e.g. when the sensor ar evenli distribut on the region). as the minimum exposur e is a random variabl, the cost of deploi the sensor in step until the desir exposur is reach is also a random variabl c. we now deriv the express for the expect valu of c. let ni be the total number of sensor deploi after each step i for a maximum number of step s so that ns = m. note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensor deploi at step i. also let cd be the cost of deploi the sensor at each step and cs be the cost of each sensor. if the desir exposur is obtain after the first step, the cost of deploy is cd + n1cs, and thi 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 number of sensor probabl ed =95% ed =90% ed

sensor ar deploi after thi step even when the desir exposur is not obtain. 5. simul in thi section, we present result of simul that were conduct to collect the exposur distribut function of the number of sensor deploi. 5.1 method the exposur distribut is obtain by collect  statist on the exposur when deploi sensor randomli in a predefin region. the random deploy is assum to be uniformli distribut over the region, which is a local  approxim. for everi deploy, the minimum exposur is found us a simul implement the algorithm  present in section 2. a decai factor of k = 2 and maximum energi of k = 60 ar chosen to model the energi emit by target (cf equat 1). the region monitor is of size 20×20 with a nois (awgn) of varianc 1, so that the signal come from the target is cover by nois when the target is 8 or more unit length awai from a sensor. the sensor us valu fusion to collabor when make a common decis on the presenc of a target in the region. the threshold for detect is chosen as a function of the number of sensor to give a constant fals alarm probabl. the fals alarm probabl for each detect attempt is chosen so that the probabl to get on or more fals alarm along a path of length 20 unit (correspond to 20 detect attempt by the sensor) is 5%. 46 0 20 40 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 cost for cd=0 and cs=1 n expectedcost 0 20 40 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 cost for cd=5 and cs=1 n expectedcost

5.2 distribut of minimum exposur the distribut of minimum exposur were found for the number of sensor deploi vari from 1 to 40. to  illustr our result, the probabl densiti function for 5, 10 and 15 sensor ar shown in figur 4. we observ that for 5 sensor deploi, the minimum  exposur ha zero densiti for valu less than the fals alarm probabl of .04. the highest densiti is obtain for  valu around .07 and then drop exponenti toward zero for higher valu of exposur. for deploy of 10 sensor, we find again that the minimum exposur ha zero densiti for valu below .04, then increas and ha about constant densiti for valu ly between .1 and .98. we also observ a peak of densiti around 1. for deploy of 15 sensor, densiti start at zero for small valu and remain veri small for most valu of minimum exposur. the densiti slowli increas and ha a larg peak for minimum exposur of 1. as expect, the minimum exposur increas on averag as the number of sensor deploi increas. when  randomli deploi 5 sensor, it is veri unlik to obtain a placement provid a desir minimum exposur. when deploi 10 sensor, most of the exposur level ar equal like and onli poor confid is given to obtain a  desir exposur level. when deploi 15 sensor, it is veri like that the sensor placement will give good exposur and thi likelihood keep increas with the number of sensor deploi. we us the cumul distribut function obtain from the statist collect to evalu the likelihood that the  desir level of exposur ed is obtain for vari number of sensor. the graph of figur 5 show the probabl that the minimum exposur is abov ed as a function of the  number of sensor deploi for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%. these valu can be us to evalu the cost express in equat 4. the graph show that the confid level to obtain a given minimum exposur level ed increas with the number of sensor deploi. the confid for ed when  deploi 40 sensor is abov .999, which is suffici for most applic, and therefor we did not evalu the  distribut of exposur when deploi more than 40 sensor. 6. result in thi section, we evalu the expect cost of deploi sensor us the simul result. the optim number of sensor to deploi at first and in the succeed step can be deriv from these result. for thi cost analysi, the region paramet and signal model ar the same as specifi in section 5. we further assum that the number of sensor deploi at everi step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ s. in thi case, equat 4 reduc to e{c} = (cd + n.cs) s−1 i=1 i. i−1 j=1 fj.n(ed) (1 − fi.n(ed)) + (s.cd + m.cs) s−1 j=1 fj.n(ed) (5) we evalu the expect cost as a function of n for three differ cost assign with a desir exposur of ed = 95%. the three correspond graph ar shown in figur 6. the first cost assign is (cd = 0, cs = 1) so that the expect cost is the expect number of sensor to be us to achiev an exposur of 95%. sinc cd = 0, the number of step us to deploi the sensor doesn"t affect the cost and it is therefor optim to deploi on sensor at a time until the minimum exposur ed is reach, as we observ on the graph. overal, the expect number of sensor to be 47 deploi increas with n but we observ a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explain by the follow analysi. the expect number of sensor is a weight sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ s that ar the differ number of sensor than can be deploi at a time when deploi n sensor at each step. for n around 16, the probabl that the minimum exposur is abov ed vari a lot as shown in figur 5 and the weight associ with the first term of the sum (n) increas rapidli while the weight associ with higher number of sensor decreas. thi is the caus of the local minimum and the cost start to increas again when the increas in n compens for the decreas in weight. the second cost assign is (cd = 5, cs = 1) so that the cost of a deploy is equal to the cost of five sensor (note that onli the rel cost of cd/cs determin the shape of the graph). in thi case, deploi on sensor at a time is prohibit by the cost of deploy and the optim number of sensor to deploi at everi step is 19. again, we find that the curv present a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variat in weight. the last cost assign is (cd = 100, cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achiev when deploi 27 sensor at everi step. these result ar specif to the region and the paramet character the signal emit by the target that were chosen for the simul. similar result can be deriv for other paramet, most of the effort resid in find the exposur distribut through simul. 7. conclus thi paper address the problem of sensor deploy in a region to be monitor for target intrus. a  mechan for sensor collabor to perform target detect is propos and analyz to evalu the exposur of path through the region. the minimum exposur is us as a measur of the good of deploy, the goal be to maxim the exposur of the least expos path in the  region. in the case where sensor ar randomli place in a region to be monitor, a mechan for sequenti deploy in step is develop. the strategi consist of deploi a  limit number of sensor at a time until the desir minimum exposur is achiev. the cost function us in thi studi depend on the number of sensor deploi in each step and the cost of each deploy. through simul, the  distribut of minimum exposur obtain by random  deploy wa evalu for vari number of sensor deploi. these result were us to evalu the cost of deploy for vari number of sensor deploi in each step. we found that the optim number of sensor deploi in each step vari with the rel cost assign to  deploy and sensor. the result of thi studi can be extend to larger region with differ target paramet. the  solut propos in thi paper can also be improv by  consid deploi variabl number of sensor at each step and thi multipl variabl problem requir further  investig. 8. acknowledg thi work wa support in part by the defens advanc research project agenc (darpa) and the air forc  research laboratori, air forc materi command, usaf, under agreement number
