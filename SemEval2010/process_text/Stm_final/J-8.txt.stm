(2) for a singl sourc multipl sink we show that for a seri parallel graph a strong equilibrium alwai exist (both for fair and gener connect game). (3) for multi sourc and sink we show that an extens parallel graph alwai admit a strong equilibrium in fair connect game. as for the qualiti of the strong equilibrium we show that in ani fair connect game the cost of a strong equilibrium is Θ(log n) from the optim solut, where n is the number of player. (thi should be contrast with the Ω(n) price of anarchi for the same set.) for singl sourc gener connect game and singl sourc singl sink fair  connect game, we show that a strong equilibrium is alwai

view that the demand side is mani time not under the control of a central author that optim the global perform, but rather under the control of  individu with differ incent, ha led alreadi to mani import insight. consid classic rout and transport problem such as multicast or multi-commod problem, which ar mani time view as follow. we ar given a graph with edg cost and connect demand between node, and our goal is to find a minim cost solut. the classic  central approach assum that all the individu demand can both be complet coordin and have no individu incent. the game theori point of view would assum that each individu demand is control by a player that optim it own util, and the result outcom could be far from the optim solut. when consid individu incent on need to  discuss the appropri solut concept. much of the research in comput game theori ha focus on the classic nash equilibrium as the primari solut concept. inde nash equilibrium ha mani benefit, and most importantli it alwai exist (in mix strategi). howev, the solut concept of nash equilibrium is resili onli to unilater  deviat, while in realiti, player mai be abl to coordin their action. a strong equilibrium [4] is a state from which no coalit (of ani size) can deviat and improv the util of everi member of the coalit (while possibl lower the util 84 of player outsid the coalit). thi resili to  deviat by coalit of the player is highli attract, and on can hope that onc a strong equilibrium is reach it is highli like to sustain. from a comput game theori point of view, an addit benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it ha a potenti to reduc the distanc between the optim solut and the solut obtain as an outcom of selfish behavior. the strong price of anarchi (spoa),  introduc in [1], is the ratio between the cost of the worst strong equilibrium and the cost of an optim solut. obvious, spoa is meaning onli in those case where a strong equilibrium exist. a major downsid of strong equilibrium is that most game do not admit ani strong equilibrium. even simpl classic game like the prison"s dilemma do not poss ani strong equilibrium (which is also an exampl of a congest game that doe not poss a strong equilibrium1 ). thi unfortun fact ha reduc the concentr in strong equilibrium, despit it highli  attract properti. yet, [1] have identifi two broad  famili of game, name job schedul and network format, where a strong equilibrium alwai exist and the spoa is significantli lower than the price of anarchi (which is the ratio between the worst nash equilibrium and the optim solut [15, 18, 5, 6]). in thi work we concentr on cost share connect game, introduc by [3, 2]. in such a game, there is an underli direct graph with edg cost, and individu user have connect demand (between a sourc and a sink). we consid two model. the fair cost connect model [2] allow each player to select a path from the sourc to the sink2 . in thi game the cost of an edg is share equal between all the player that select the edg, and the cost of the player is the sum of it cost on the edg it select. the gener connect game [3] allow each player to offer price for edg. in thi game an edg is bought if the sum of the offer at least cover it cost, and the cost of the player is the sum of it offer on the bought edg (in both game we assum that the player ha to guarante the connect between it sourc and sink). in thi work we focu on two import issu. the first on is identifi under what condit the exist of a strong equilibrium is guarante, and the second on is the qualiti of the strong equilibria. for the exist part, we identifi famili of graph topolog that possess some strong equilibrium for ani assign of edg cost. on can view thi separ between the graph topolog and the edg cost, as a separ between the underli infrastructur and the cost the player observ to purchas edg. while on expect the infrastructur to be stabl over long period of time, the cost the player observ can be easili modifi over short time period. such a topolog character of the underli infrastructur provid a network design topolog condit that will ensur stabil in hi  network. our result ar as follow. for the singl commod case (all the player have the same sourc and sink), there is a strong equilibrium in ani graph (both for fair and gener connect game). moreov, the strong equilibrium is also 1 while ani congest game is known to admit at least on nash equilibrium in pure strategi [16]. 2 the fair cost share scheme is also attract from a  mechan design point of view, as it is a strategyproof  costshar mechan [14]. the optim solut (name, the player share a shortest path from the common sourc to the common sink). for the case of a singl sourc and multipl sink (for  exampl, in a multicast tree), we show that in a fair connect game there is a strong equilibrium if the underli graph is a seri parallel graph, and we show an exampl of a  nonseri parallel graph that doe not have a strong equilibrium. for the case of multi-commod (multi sourc and sink), we show that in a fair connect game if the graph is an extens parallel graph then there is alwai a strong  equilibrium, and we show an exampl of a seri parallel graph that doe not have a strong equilibrium. as far as we know, we ar the first to provid a topolog character for equilibrium exist in multi-commod and singl-sourc network game. for ani fair connect game we show that if there exist a strong equilibrium it is at most a factor of Θ(log n) from the optim solut, where n is the number of player. thi should be contrast with the Θ(n) bound that exist for the price of anarchi [2]. for singl sourc gener connect game, we show that ani seri parallel graph possess a strong equilibrium, and we show an exampl of a graph that doe not have a strong equilibrium. in thi case we also show that ani strong  equilibrium is optim. relat work topolog character for singl-commod network game have been recent provid for variou equilibrium properti, includ equilibrium exist [12, 7, 8],  equilibrium uniqu [10] and equilibrium effici [17, 11]. the exist of pure nash equilibrium in singl-commod  network congest game with player-specif cost or weight wa studi in [12]. the exist of strong equilibrium wa studi in both util-decreas (e.g., rout) and util-increas (e.g., fair cost-share) congest game. [7, 8] have provid a full topolog character for a se exist in singl-commod util-decreas  congest game, and show that a se alwai exist if and onli if the underli graph is extens-parallel. [19] have shown that in singl-commod util-increas  congest game, the topolog character is essenti equival to parallel link. in addit, thei have shown that these result hold for correl strong equilibria as well (in contrast to the decreas set, where correl strong equilibria might not exist at all). while the fair cost share game we studi ar util increas network  congest game, we deriv a differ character than [19] due to the differ assumpt regard the player" action.3 2. model 2.1 game theori definit a game Λ =< n, (Σi), (ci) > ha a finit set n = {1, . . . , n} of player. player i ∈ n ha a set Σi of action, the joint  action set is Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn and a joint action s ∈ Σ is also call a profil. the cost function of player i is 3 in [19] thei allow to restrict some player from us certain link, even though the link exist in the graph, while we do not allow thi, and assum that the avail strategi for player ar fulli repres by the underli graph. 85 ci : Σ → r+ , which map the joint action s ∈ Σ to a non-neg real number. let s = (s1, . . . , sn) denot the profil of action taken by the player, and let s−i = (s1, . . . , si−1, si+1, . . . , sn) denot the profil of action taken by all player other than player i. note that s = (si, s−i). the social cost of a game Λ is the sum of the cost of the player, and we denot by opt(Λ) the minim social cost of a game Λ. i.e., opt(Λ) = min∈Σ costΛ(s), where costΛ(s) = i∈n ci(s). a joint action s ∈ Σ is a pure nash equilibrium if no player i ∈ n can benefit from unilater deviat from hi action to anoth action, i.e., ∀i ∈ n ∀si ∈ Σi : ci(s−i, si) ≥ ci(s). we denot by ne(Λ) the set of pure nash equilibria in the game Λ. resili to coalit: a pure deviat of a set of  player Γ ⊂ n (also call coalit) specifi an action for each player in the coalit, i.e., γ ∈ ×i∈ΓΣi. a joint action s ∈ Σ is not resili to a pure deviat of a coalit Γ if there is a pure joint action γ of Γ such that ci(s−Γ, γ) < ci(s) for everi i ∈ Γ (i.e., the player in the coalit can deviat in such a wai that each player in the coalit reduc it cost). a pure nash equilibrium s ∈ Σ is a k-strong equilibrium, if there is no coalit Γ of size at most k, such that s is not resili to a pure deviat by Γ. we denot by k-se(Λ) the set of k-strong equilibria in the game Λ. we denot by se(Λ) the set of n-strong equilibria, and call s ∈ se(Λ) a strong equilibrium (se). next we defin the price of anarchi [9], price of  stabil [2], and their extens to strong price of anarchi and strong price of stabil. of anarchi (k-spoa) for the game Λ. the price of anarchi (poa) is the ratio between the maxim cost of a pure nash equilibrium (assum on exist) and the social optimum, i.e., max∈ne(Λ) costΛ(s) /opt(Λ). similarli, the price of stabil (po) is the  ratio between the minim cost of a pure nash equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., min∈ne(Λ) costΛ(s)/opt(Λ). the k-strong price of anarchi (k-spoa) is the ratio between the maxim cost of a k-strong equilibrium (assum on exist) and the social optimum, i.e., max∈k-se(Λ) costΛ(s) /opt(Λ). the spoa is the n-spoa. similarli, the strong price of stabil (spo) is the ratio between the minim cost of a pure strong equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., min∈se(Λ) costΛ(s)/opt(Λ). note that both k-spoa and spo ar defin onli if some strong equilibrium exist. 2.2 cost share connect game a cost share connect game ha an underli  direct graph g = (v, e) where each edg e ∈ e ha an associ cost ce ≥ 04 . in a connect game each player i ∈ n ha an associ sourc si and sink ti. in a fair connect game the action Σi of player i  includ all the path from si to ti. the cost of each edg is share equal by the set of all player whose path  contain it. given a joint action, the cost of a player is the sum of hi cost on the edg it select. more formal, the cost function of each player on an edg e, in a joint action s, is fe(ne(s)) = ce ne(s) , where ne(s) is the  number of player that select a path contain edg e in s. the cost of player i, when select path qi ∈ Σi is ci(s) = e∈qi fe(ne(s)). 4 in some of the exist proof, we assum that ce > 0 for simplic. the full version contain the complet proof for the case ce ≥ 0. in a gener connect game the action Σi of player i is a payment vector pi, where pi(e) is how much player i is offer to contribut to the cost of edg e.5 given a profil p, ani edg e such that i pi(e) ≥ ce is consid bought, and ep denot the set of bought edg. let gp = (v, ep) denot the graph bought by the player for profil p = (p1, . . . , pn). clearli, each player tri to minim hi total payment which is ci(p) = e∈ep pi(e) if si is connect to ti in gp, and infin otherwis.6 we denot by c(p) = i ci(p) the total cost under the profil p. for a subgraph h of g we denot the total cost of the edg in h by c(h). a symmetr connect game impli that the sourc and sink of all the player ar ident. (we also call a  symmetr connect game a singl sourc singl sink connect game, or a singl commod connect game.) a singl sourc connect game impli that the sourc of all the player ar ident. final, a multi commod connect game impli that each player ha it own sourc and sink. 2.3 extens parallel and seri parallel direct graph our direct graph would be acycl, and would have a sourc node (from which all node ar reachabl) and a sink node (which everi node can reach). we first defin the follow action for composit of direct graph. • identif: the identif oper allow to collaps two node to on. more formal, given graph g = (v, e) we defin the identif of a node v1 ∈ v and v2 ∈ v form a new node v ∈ v as creat a new graph g = (v , e ), where v = v −{v1, v2}∪{v} and e includ the edg of e where the edg of v1 and v2 ar now connect to v. • parallel composit: given two direct graph, g1 = (v1, e1) and g2 = (v2, e2), with sourc s1 ∈ v1 and s2 ∈ v2 and sink t1 ∈ v1 and t2 ∈ v2, respect, we defin a new graph g = g1||g2 as follow. let g = (v1 ∪ v2, e1 ∪ e2) be the union graph. to creat g = g1||g2 we identifi the sourc s1 and s2, form a new sourc node s, and identifi the sink t1 and t2, form a new sink t. • seri composit: given two direct graph, g1 = (v1, e1) and g2 = (v2, e2), with sourc s1 ∈ v1 and s2 ∈ v2 and sink t1 ∈ v1 and t2 ∈ v2, respect, we defin a new graph g = g1 → g2 as follow. let g = (v1 ∪ v2, e1 ∪ e2) be the union graph. to creat g = g1 → g2 we identifi the vertic t1 and s2, form a new vertex u. the graph g ha a sourc s = s1 and a sink t = t2. • extens composit : a seri composit when on of the graph, g1 or g2, is compos of a  singl direct edg is an extens composit, and we denot it by g = g1 →e g2. an extens parallel graph (epg) is a graph g consist of either: (1) a singl direct edg (s, t), (2) a graph g = g1||g2 or (3) a graph g = g1 →e g2, where g1 and g2 ar 5 we limit the player to select a path connect si to ti and payment onli on those edg. 6 thi impli that in equilibrium everi player ha it sink and sourc connect by a path in gp. 86 extens parallel graph (and in the extens composit either g1 or g2 is a singl edg.). a seri parallel graph (spg) is a graph g consist of either: (1) a singl direct edg (s, t), (2) a graph g = g1||g2 or (3) a graph g = g1 → g2, where g1 and g2 ar seri parallel graph. given a path q and two vertic u, v on q, we denot the subpath of q from u to v by qu,v. the follow lemma, whose proof appear in the full version, would be the main topolog tool in the case of singl sourc graph. lemma 2.1. let g be an spg with sourc s and sink t. given a path q, from s to t, and a vertex t , there exist a vertex y ∈ q, such that for ani path q from s to t , the path q contain y and the path qy,t and q ar edg disjoint. (we call the vertex y the intersect vertex of q and t .) 3. fair connect game thi section deriv our result for fair connect game. 3.1 exist of strong equilibrium while it is known that everi fair connect game  possess a nash equilibrium in pure strategi [2], thi is not necessarili the case for a strong equilibrium. in thi section, we studi the exist of strong equilibrium in fair  connect game. we begin with a simpl case, show that everi symmetr fair connect game possess a strong  equilibrium. theorem 3.1. in everi symmetr fair connect game there exist a strong equilibrium. proof. let s be the sourc and t be the sink of all the player. we show that a profil s in which all the player choos the same shortest path q (from the sourc s to the sink t ) is a strong equilibrium. suppos by contradict that s is not a se. then there is a coalit Γ that can deviat to a new profil s such that the cost of everi player j ∈ Γ decreas. let qj be a new path us by player j ∈ Γ. sinc q is a shortest path, it hold that c(qj \ (q ∩ qj)) ≥ c(q \ (q ∩ qj)), for ani path qj. therefor for everi player j ∈ Γ we have that cj(s ) ≥ cj(s). howev, thi contradict the fact that all player in Γ reduc their cost. (in fact, no player in Γ ha reduc it cost.) while everi symmetr fair connect game admit a se, it doe not hold for everi fair connect game. in what  follow, we studi the network topolog that admit a strong equilibrium for ani assign of edg cost, and give  exampl of topolog for which a strong equilibrium doe not exist. the follow lemma, whose proof appear in the full version, plai a major role in our proof of the exist of se. lemma 3.2. let Λ be a fair connect game on a seri parallel graph g with sourc s and sink t. assum that player i ha si = s and ti = t and that Λ ha some se. let s be a se that minim the cost of player i (out of all se), i.e., ci(s) = mint ∈se(Λ) ci(t) and let s∗ be the profil that minim the cost of player i (out of all possibl profil), i.e., ci(s∗ ) = mint ∈Σ ci(t). then, ci(s) = ci(s∗ ). the next lemma consid parallel composit. lemma 3.3. let Λ be a fair connect game on graph g = g1||g2, where g1 and g2 ar seri parallel graph. if everi fair connect game on the graph g1 and g2  possess a strong equilibrium, then the game Λ possess a strong equilibrium. proof. let g1 = (v1, e1) and g2 = (v2, e2) have sourc s1 and s2 and sink t1 and t2, respect. let ti be the set of player with an endpoint in vi \ {s, t}, for i ∈ {1, 2}. (an endpoint is either a sourc or a sink of a player). let t3 be the set of player j such that sj = s and tj = t. let Λ1 and Λ2 be the origin game on the respect graph g1 and g2 with player t1 ∪ t3 and t2 ∪ t3, respect. let s and s be the se in Λ1 and Λ2 that minim the cost of player in t3, respect. assum w.l.o.g. that ci(s ) ≤ ci(s ) where player i ∈ t3. in addit, let Λ2 be the game on the graph g2 with player t2 and let ¯s be a se in Λ2. we will show that the profil s = s ∪ ¯s is a se in Λ. suppos by contradict that s is not a se. then, there is a coalit Γ that can deviat such that the cost of everi player j ∈ Γ decreas. by lemma 3.2 and the assumpt that ci(s ) ≤ ci(s ), a player j ∈ t3 cannot improv hi cost. therefor, Γ ⊆ t1 ∪ t2. but thi is a contradict to s be a se in Λ1 or ¯s be a se in Λ2. the follow theorem consid the case of singl sourc fair connect game. theorem 3.4. everi singl sourc fair connect game on a seri-parallel graph possess a strong equilibrium. proof. we prove the theorem by induct on the  network size |v |. the claim obvious hold if |v | = 2. we show the claim for a seri composit, i.e., g = g1 → g2, and for a parallel composit, i.e., g = g1||g2, where g1 = (v1, e1) and g2 = (v2, e2) ar spg"s with sourc s1, s2, and sink t1, t2, respect. seri composit. let g = g1 → g2. let t1 be the set of player j such that tj ∈ v1, and t2 be the set of player j such that tj ∈ v2 \ {s2}. let Λ1 and Λ2 be the origin game on the respect graph g1 and g2 with player t1 ∪ t2 and t2, respect. for everi player i ∈ t2 with action si in the game Λ let si ∩e1 be hi induc action in the game Λ1, and let si ∩e2 be hi induc action in the game Λ2. let s be a se in Λ1 that minim the cost of player in t2 (such a se exist by the induct hypothesi and lemma 3.2). let s be ani se in Λ2. we will show that the profil s = s ∪ s is a se in the game Λ, i.e., for player j ∈ t2 we us the profil sj = sj ∪ sj . suppos by contradict that s is not a se. then, there is a coalit Γ that can deviat such that the cost of everi player j ∈ Γ decreas. now, there ar two case: case 1: Γ ⊆ t1. thi is a contradict to s be a se. case 2: there exist a player j ∈ Γ ∩ t2. by lemma 3.2, player j cannot improv hi cost in Λ1 so the improv is due to Λ2. consid the coalit Γ ∩ t2, it would still improv it cost. howev, thi contradict the fact that s is a se in Λ2. parallel composit. follow from lemma 3.3. while multi-commod fair connect game on seri parallel graph do not necessarili possess a se (see  theorem 3.6), fair connect game on extens parallel graph alwai possess a strong equilibrium. theorem 3.5. everi fair connect game on an  extens parallel graph possess a strong equilibrium. 87 t2 t1 s1 s2 2 2 1 3 3 1 (b)(a) a b e f c d figur 1: graph topolog. proof. we prove the theorem by induct on the  network size |v |. let Λ be a fair connect game on an epg g = (v, e). the claim obvious hold if |v | = 2. if the graph g is a parallel composit of two epg graph g1 and g2, then the claim follow from lemma 3.3. it remain to prove the claim for extens composit. suppos the graph g is an extens composit of the graph g1  consist of a singl edg e = (s1, t1) and an epg g2 = (v2, e2) with termin s2, t2, such that s = s1 and t = t2. (the case that g2 is a singl edg is similar.) let t1 be the set of player with sourc s1 and sink t1 (i.e., their path is in g1). let t2 be the set of player with sourc and sink in g2. let t3 be the set of player with sourc s1 and sink in v2 \ t1. let Λ1 and Λ2 be the origin game on the respect graph g1 and g2 with player t1 ∪ t3 and t2 ∪ t3,  respect. let s , s be se in Λ1 and Λ2 respect. we will show that the profil s = s ∪ s is a se in the game Λ. suppos by contradict that s is not a se. then, there is a coalit Γ of minim size that can deviat such that the cost of ani player j ∈ Γ decreas. clearli, t1 ∩Γ = φ, sinc player in t1 have a singl strategi. henc, Γ ⊆ t2 ∪t3. ani player j ∈ t2 ∪t3 cannot improv hi cost in Λ1. therefor, ani player j ∈ t2 ∪ t3 improv hi cost in Λ2. howev, thi contradict the fact that s is a se in Λ2. in the follow theorem we provid a few exampl of topolog in which a strong equilibrium doe not exist, show that our character is almost tight. theorem 3.6. the follow connect game exist: (1) there exist a multi-commod fair connect game on a seri parallel graph that doe not possess a strong  equilibrium. (2) there exist a singl sourc fair connect game that doe not possess a strong equilibrium. proof. for claim (1) consid the graph depict in  figur 1(a). thi game ha a uniqu ne where s1 = {e, c}, s2 = {b, f}, and each player ha a cost of 5.7 howev,  consid the follow coordin deviat s . s1 = {a, b, c}, 7 in ani ne of the game, player 1 will bui the edg e and player 2 will bui the edg f. thi is sinc the altern path, in the respect part, will cost the player 2.5. thu, player 1 (player 2) will bui the edg c (edg b) alon, and each player will have a cost of 5. s 2 + 2 2 1 − 2 1 + 3 1 2 − 3 1 1 1 2 − 3 t1 t2 a c d e f h g b figur 2: exampl of a singl sourc connect game that doe not admit se. and s2 = {b, c, d}. in thi profil, each player pai a cost of 4, and thu improv it cost. for claim (2) consid a singl sourc fair connect game on the graph g depict in figur 2. there ar two player. player i = 1, 2 wish to connect the sourc s to it sink ti and the uniqu ne is s1 = {a, b}, s2 = {a, c}, and each player ha a cost of 2. 8 then, both player can deviat to s1 = {h, f, d} and s2 = {h, f, e}, and decreas their cost to 2 − /2. unfortun, our character is not complet tight. the graph in figur 1(b) is an exampl of a non-extens parallel graph which alwai admit a strong equilibrium. 3.2 strong price of anarchi while the price of anarchi in fair connect game can be as bad as n, the follow theorem show that the strong price of anarchi is bound by h(n) = n i=1 1 i = Θ(log n). theorem 3.7. the strong price of anarchi of a fair  connect game with n player is at most h(n). proof. let Λ be a fair connect game on the graph g. we denot by Λ(Γ) the game plai on the graph g by a set of player Γ, where the action of player i ∈ Γ remain Σi (the same as in Λ). let s = (s1, . . . , sn) be a profil in the game Λ. we denot by s(Γ) = sΓ the induc profil of player in Γ in the game Λ(Γ). let ne(s(Γ)) denot the load of edg e under the profil s(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), i.e., ne(s(Γ)) = |{j|j ∈ Γ, e ∈ sj}|. similar to congest game [16, 13] we denot by Φ(s(Γ)) the potenti function of the profil s(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), where Φ(s(Γ)) = e∈e ne(s(Γ)) j=1 fe(j), and defin Φ(s(φ)) = 0. in our case, it hold that Φ(s) = e∈e ce · h(ne(s)). (1) let s be a se, and let s∗ be the profil of the optim solut. we defin an order on the player as follow. let Γn = {1, ..., n} be the set of all the player. for each k = 8 we can show that thi is the uniqu ne by a simpl case analysi: (i) if s1 = {h, f, d} and s2 = {h, f, e}, then player 1 can deviat to s1 = {h, g} and decreas hi cost. (ii) if s1 = {h, g} and s2 = {h, f, e}, then player 2 can deviat to s2 = {a, c} and decreas hi cost. (iii) if s1 = {h, g} and s2 = {a, c}, then player 1 can deviat to s1 = {a, b} and decreas hi cost. 88 n, . . . , 1, sinc s is a se, there exist a player in Γk, w.l.o.g. call it player k, such that, ck(s) ≤ ck(s−Γk , s∗ Γk ). (2) in thi wai, Γk is defin recurs, such that for everi k = n, . . . , 2 it hold that Γk−1 = Γk \ {k}. (i.e., after the renam, Γk = {1, . . . , k}.) let ck(s(Γk)) denot the cost of player k in the game Λ(Γk) under the induc profil s(Γk). it is easi to see that ck(s(Γk)) = Φ(s(Γk)) − Φ(s(Γk−1)).9 therefor, ck(s) ≤ ck(s−Γk , s∗ Γk ) (3) ≤ ck(s∗ (Γk)) = Φ(s∗ (Γk)) − Φ(s∗ (Γk−1)). sum over all player, we obtain: i∈n ci(s) ≤ Φ(s∗ (Γn)) − Φ(s∗ (φ)) = Φ(s∗ (Γn)) = e∈s∗ ce · h(ne(s∗ )) ≤ e∈s∗ ce · h(n) = h(n) · opt(Λ), where the first inequ follow sinc the sum of the right hand side of equat (3) telescop, and the second equal follow from equat (1). next we bound the spoa when coalit of size at most k ar allow. theorem 3.8. the k-spoa of a fair connect game with n player is at most n k · h(k). proof. let s be a se of Λ, and s∗ be the profil of the optim solut of Λ. to simplifi the proof, we assum that n/k is an integ. we partit the player to n/k group t1, . . . , tn/k each of size k. let Λj be the game on the graph g plai by the set of player tj. let s(tj) denot the profil of the k player in tj in the game Λj induc by the profil s of the game Λ. by theorem 3.7, it hold that for each game Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k, costΛj (s(tj)) = i∈tj ci(s(tj)) ≤ h(k) · opt(Λj) ≤ h(k) · opt(Λ). sum over all game Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k, costΛ(s) ≤ n/k j=1 costΛj (s(tj)) ≤ n k · h(k) · opt(Λ), where the first inequ follow sinc for each group tj and player i ∈ tj, it hold that ci(s) ≤ ci(s(tj)). next we show an almost match lower bound. (the lower bound is at most h(n) = o(log n) from the upper bound and both for k = o(1) and k = Ω(n) the differ is onli a constant.) theorem 3.9. for fair connect game with n player, k-spoa ≥ max{n k , h(n)}. 9 thi follow sinc for ani strategi profil s, if a singl player k deviat to strategi sk, then the chang in the potenti valu Φ(s) − Φ(sk, s−k) is exactli the chang in the cost to player k. t2 s

uniqu nash equilibrium is also a strong equilibrium, and therefor k-spoa = h(n) for ani 1 ≤ k ≤ n. for the lower bound of n/k, consid a graph compos of two parallel link of cost 1 and n/k. consid the profil s in which all n player us the link of cost n/k. the cost of each player is 1/k, while if ani coalit of size at most k deviat to the link of cost 1, the cost of each player is at least 1/k. therefor, the profil s is a k-se, and k-spoa = n/k. the result of theorem 3.7 and 3.8 can be extend to concav cost function. consid the extend fair  connect game, where each edg ha a cost which depend on the number of player us that edg, ce(ne). we assum that the cost function ce(ne) is a nondecreas, concav  function. note that the cost of an edg ce(ne) might increas with the number of player us it, but the cost per player fe(ne) = ce(ne)/ne decreas when ce(ne) is concav. theorem 3.10. the strong price of anarchi of a fair  connect game with nondecreas concav edg cost function and n player is at most h(n). proof. the proof is analogu to the proof of  theorem 3.7. for the proof we show that cost(s) ≤ Φ(s∗ ) ≤ h(n)·cost(s∗ ). we first show the first inequ. sinc the function ce(x) is concav, the cost per player ce(x)/x is a nonincreas function. therefor inequ (3) in the proof of theorem 3.7 hold. sum inequ (3) over all  player we obtain cost(s) = i ci(s) ≤ Φ(s∗ (Γn))−Φ(s∗ (φ)) = Φ(s∗ ). the second inequ follow sinc ce(x) is  nondecreas and therefor ne x=1(ce(x)/x) ≤ h(ne) · ce(ne). us the argument in the proof of theorem 3.10 and the proof of theorem 3.8 we deriv, theorem 3.11. the k-spoa of a fair connect game with nondecreas concav edg cost function and n player is at most n k · h(k). sinc the set of strong equilibria is contain in the set of nash equilibria, it must hold that spoa ≤ poa, mean that the spoa can onli be improv compar to the poa. howev, with respect to the price of stabil the opposit direct hold, that is, spo ≥ po. we next show that there exist a fair connect game in which the inequ is strict. 89 2 − 2 − 2 − 3 s t1 t2 t3 figur 4: exampl of a singl sourc gener connect game that doe not admit a strong equilibrium. the edg that ar not label with cost have a cost of zero. theorem 3.12. there exist a fair connect game in which spo > po. proof. consid a singl sourc fair connect game on the graph g depict in figur 3.10 player i = 1, . . . , n wish to connect the sourc s to hi sink ti. assum that each player i = 1, . . . , n − 2 ha hi own path of cost 1/i from s to ti and player i = n − 1, n have a joint path of cost 2/n from s to ti. addition, all player can share a common path of cost 1+ for some small > 0. the optim solut connect all player through the common path of cost 1 + , and thi is also a nash equilibrium with total cost 1 + . it is easi to verifi that the solut where each player i = 1, . . . , n−2 us hi own path and user i = n−1, n us their joint path is the uniqu strong equilibrium of thi game with total cost n−2 i=1 1 i + 2 n = Θ(log n) while the exampl abov show that the spo mai be greater than the po, the upper bound of h(n) = Θ(log n), proven for the po [2], serv as an upper bound for the spo as well. thi is a direct corollari from theorem 3.7, as spo ≤ spoa by definit. corollari 3.13. the strong price of stabil of a fair connect game with n player is at most h(n) = o(log n). 4. gener connect game in thi section, we deriv our result for gener connect game. 4.1 exist of strong equilibrium we begin with a character of the exist of a strong equilibrium in symmetr gener connect game. similar to theorem 3.1 (us a similar proof) we establish, theorem 4.1. in everi symmetr fair connect game there exist a strong equilibrium. while everi singl sourc gener connect game  possess a pure nash equilibrium [3], it doe not necessarili admit some strong equilibrium.11 10 thi is a variat on the exampl given in [2]. 11 we thank elliot anshelevich, whose similar topolog for the fair-connect game inspir thi exampl. theorem 4.2. there exist a singl sourc gener  connect game that doe not admit ani strong equilibrium. proof. consid singl sourc gener connect game with 3 player on the graph depict in figur 4. player i wish to connect the sourc s with it sink ti.we need to consid onli the ne profil: (i) if all three player us the link of cost 3, then there must be two agent whose total sum exce 2, thu thei can both reduc cost by deviat to an edg of cost 2− . (ii) if two of the player us an edg of cost 2− jointli, and the third player us a differ edg of cost 2 − , then, the player with non-zero payment can deviat to the path with the edg of cost 3 and reduc their cost (sinc befor the deviat the total payment of the player is 4 − 2 ). we show that none of the ne ar se, and thu the game doe not possess ani se. next we show that for the class of seri parallel graph, there is alwai a strong equilibrium in the case of a singl sourc. theorem 4.3. in everi singl sourc gener connect game on a seri-parallel graph, there exist a strong  equilibrium. proof. let Λ be a singl sourc gener connect game on a spg g = (v, e) with sourc s and sink t. we present an algorithm that construct a specif se. we first consid the follow partial order between the player. for player i and j, we have that i → j if there is a direct path from ti to tj. we complet the partial order to a full order (in an arbitrari wai), and w.l.o.g. we assum that 1 → 2 → · · · → n. the algorithm comput-se, consid the player in an increas order, start with player 1. each player i will fulli bui a subset of the edg, and ani player j > i will consid the cost of those (bought) edg as zero. when comput-se consid player j, the cost of the edg that player 1 to j−1 have bought is set to zero, and player j fulli bui a shortest path qj from s to tj. name, for everi edg e ∈ qj \ ∪i<jqi we have pj(e) = ce and otherwis pj(e) = 0. we next show that the algorithm  computes comput a se. assum by wai of contradict that the profil p is not a se. then, there exist a coalit that can improv the cost of all it player by a deviat. let Γ be such a coalit of minim size and let player i = max{j ∈ Γ}. for a player j ∈ Γ let ¯qj and ¯pj be the path and payment of player j after the deviat, respect. let q be a path from the sink of player i, i.e. ti, to the sink of g, i.e. t. then q = ¯qi ∪ q is a path from the sourc s to the sink t. for ani player j < i, let yj be the intersect vertex of q and tj (by lemma 2.1 on is guarante to exist). let y be the furthest vertex on the path q such that y = yj for some j < i. the path from the sourc s to node y wa fulli paid for by player j < i in p (befor the deviat). there ar two case we consid. case a: after the deviat player i doe not pai for edg in j∈Γ\{i} ¯qj . thi is a contradict to the minim of the coalit Γ size, sinc the player in Γ \ {i} can form a smaller coalit with payment ¯p. case b: otherwis, we show that player i cost after the  deviat, i.e. ci(¯p), is at least hi cost befor the deviat, i.e. ci(p), contradict the fact that player i improv hi cost. recal that given two vertic u, v on path ¯q we denot by ¯qu,v the subpath of ¯q from u to v. 90 befor the deviat of the coalit Γ, a path from s to y wa fulli paid for by the player j < i. next we show that no player k > i pai for ani edg on ani path from s to ti. consid a player k > i and let qk = qk ∪ qk , where qk is a path connect tk to t. let yk be the intersect vertex of qk and ti. sinc there exist a path from s to yk that wa fulli paid for by player j < k befor the deviat, in  particularli the path qi s,yk , player k will not pai for ani edg on ani path connect s and yk. therefor player i fulli pai for all edg on the path ¯qi y,ti , i.e., ¯pi(e) = ce for all edg e ∈ ¯qi y,ti . now consid the algorithm  computes at the step when player i select a shortest path from the sourc s to it sink ti and determin hi payment pi. at thi point, player i could bui the path ¯qi y,ti , sinc a path from s to y wa alreadi paid for by player j < i. henc, ci(¯p) ≥ ci(p). thi contradict the fact that player i  improv it cost and therefor not all the player in Γ reduc their cost. thi impli that p is a strong equilibrium. 4.2 strong price of anarchi while for everi singl sourc gener connect game, it hold that po = 1 [3], the price of anarchi can be as larg as n, even for two parallel edg. here, we show that ani strong equilibrium in singl sourc gener connect game yield the optim cost. theorem 4.4. in singl sourc gener connect game, if there exist a strong equilibrium, then the strong price of anarchi is 1. proof. let p = (p1, . . . , pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let t∗ be the minimum cost steiner tree on all player, root at the (singl) sourc s. let t∗ e be the subtre of t∗ disconnect from s when edg e is remov. let Γ(te) be the set of player which have sink in te. for a set of edg e, let c(e) = e∈e ce. let p(te) = i∈Γ(te) ci(p). assum by wai of contradict that c(p) > c(t∗ ). we will show that there exist a sub-tree t of t∗ , that connect a subset of player Γ ⊆ n, and a new set of payment ¯p, such that for each i ∈ Γ, ci(¯p) < ci(p). thi will contradict the assumpt that p is a strong equilibrium. first we show how to find a sub-tree t of t∗ , such that for ani edg e, the payment of player with sink in t∗ e is more than the cost of t∗ e ∪ {e}. to build t , defin an edg e to be bad if the cost of t∗ e ∪ {e} is at least the payment of the player with sink in t∗ e , i.e., c(t∗ e ∪ {e}) ≥ p(t∗ e ). let b be the set of bad edg. we defin t to be t∗ − ∪e∈b(t∗ e ∪ {e}). note that we can find a subset b of b such that ∪e∈b(t∗ e ∪ {e}) is equal to ∪e∈b (t∗ e ∪ {e}) and for ani e1, e2 ∈ b we have t∗ e1 ∩ t∗ e2 = ∅. (the set b will includ ani edg e ∈ b for which there is no other edg e ∈ b on the path from e to the sourc s.) consid the edg in e ∈ b we can see that ani subtre t∗ e we delet from t can not decreas the differ between the payment and the cost of the remain tree. therefor, in t for everi edg e, we have that c(te ∪ {e}) < p(te). now we have a tree t and our coalit will be Γ(t ). what remain is to find payment ¯p for the player in Γ(t ) such that thei will bui the tree t and everi player in Γ(t ) will lower it cost, i.e. ci(p) > ci(¯p) for i ∈ Γ(t ). (recal that the payment have the restrict that player i can onli pai for edg on the path from s to ti.) we will now defin the coalit payment ¯p. let ci(¯p, te) = e∈te ¯pi(e) be the payment of player i for the  subtre te. we will show that for everi subtre te, ci(¯p, te ∪ {e}) < ci(p), and henc ci(¯p) < ci(p). consid the  follow bottom up process that defin ¯p. we assign the payment of edg e in t , after we assign payment to all the edg in te. thi impli that when we assign payment for e, we have that the sum of the payment in te is equal to c(te) = i∈Γ(te) ci(¯p, te). sinc e wa not a bad edg, we know that c(te ∪ {e}) = c(te) + ce < p(te). therefor, we can updat the payment ¯p of player i ∈ Γ(te), by set ¯pi(e) = ce∆i/( j∈Γ(te) ∆j), where ∆j = cj(p) − cj(¯p, te). after the updat we have for player i ∈ Γ(te), ci(¯p, te ∪ {e}) = ci(¯p, te) + ¯pi(e) = ci(¯p, te) + ∆i ce j∈Γ(te) ∆j = ci(p) − ∆i(1 − ce p(Γ(te)) − c(te) ), where we us the fact that j∈Γ(te) ∆j = p(Γ(te))−c(te). sinc ce < p(Γ(te)) − c(te) it follow that ci(¯p, te ∪ {e}) < ci(p). 5. refer [1] n. andelman, m. feldman, and y. mansour. strong price of anarchi. in soda"07, 2007.
