i.2.8 [artifici intellig]: problem solv, control method, and search-plan execut, format, and  gener; i.2.11 [artifici intellig]: distribut  artifici intellig-coher and coordin gener term algorithm 1. introduct much research ha been undertaken to increas satellit autonomi such as enabl them to solv by themselv problem that mai occur dure a mission, adapt their behaviour to new event and transfer plan on-board ; even if the develop cost of such a satellit is increas, there is an increas in perform and mission possibl [34]. moreov, the us of satellit swarm - set of satellit fly in format or in constel around the  earthmak it possibl to consid joint activ, to distribut skill and to ensur robust. multi-agent architectur have been develop for satellit swarm [36, 38, 42] but strong assumpt on deliber and commun capabl ar made in order to build a collect plan. mono-agent plan [4, 18, 28] and task alloc [20] ar wide studi. in a multi-agent context, agent that build a collect plan must be abl to chang their goal, realloc resourc and react to environ chang and to the other" choic. a coordin step must be ad to the plan step [40, 30, 11]. howev, thi step need high commun and comput capabl. for instanc, coalit-base [37], contract-base [35] and all  negotiationbas [25] mechan need these capabl, especi in dynam environ. in order to relax commun constraint, coordin base on norm and convent [16] or strategi [17] ar consid. norm constraint agent in their decis in such a wai that the possibl of conflict ar reduc. strategi ar privat decis rule that allow an agent to draw benefit from the knowledg world without  commun. howev, commun is still need in order to share inform and build collect conjectur and plan. commun can be achiev through a stigmerg  approach (via the environ) or through messag exchang and a protocol. a protocol defin interact between agent and cannot be uncoupl from it goal, e.g.  exchang inform, find a trade-off, alloc task and so on. protocol can be view as an abstract of an  interact [9]. thei mai be repres in a varieti of wai, e.g. auml [32] or petri-net [23]. as protocol ar  origin design for a singl goal, some work aim at  endow them with flexibl [8, 26]. howev, an agent cannot alwai commun with anoth agent or the  commun possibilit ar restrict to short time interv. the object of thi work is to us intersatellit  connect, call intersatellit link or isl, in an earth  observ constel inspir from the fuego mission [13, 19], in order to increas the system reactiv and to improv the mission global return through a hybrid agent approach. at the individu level, agent ar delib in order to creat a local plan but at the collect level, thei us norm decis rule in order to coordin with on anoth. we will present the featur of our problem, a commun protocol, a method for request alloc and final,  collabor strategi. 287 978-81-904262-7-5 (rp) c 2007 ifaama 2. problem featur an observ satellit constel is a set of satellit in variou orbit whose mission is to take pictur of variou area on the earth surfac, for exampl hot point  correspond to volcano or forest fire. the ground send the constel observ request character by their  geograph posit, prioriti specifi if the request ar urgent or not, the desir date of observ and the  desir date for data download. the satellit ar equip with a singl observ  instrument whose mirror can roll to shift the line of sight. a minimum durat is necessari to move the mirror, so  request that ar too close togeth cannot be realiz by the same satellit. the satellit ar also equip with a  detect instrument point forward that detect hot point and gener observ request on-board. the constel that we consid ar such as the orbit of the variou satellit meet around the pole. a judici posit of the satellit in their orbit make it possibl to consid that two (or more) satellit meet in the polar  area, and thu can commun without the ground  intervent. intuit, intersatellit commun increas the reactiv of the constel sinc each satellit is within direct view of a ground station (and thu can commun with it) onli 10 % of the time. the featur of the problem ar the follow: - 3 to 20 satellit in the constel; - pair commun around the pole; - no ground intervent dure the plan process; - asynchron request with variou prioriti. 3. a multi-agent approach as each satellit is a singl entiti that is a piec of the global swarm, a multi-agent system fit to model satellit constel [39]. thi approach ha been develop through the objectag architectur [38], teamag [31], dip [14] or prospect ant [12]. 3.1 satellit swarm an observ satellit swarm1 is a multi-agent system where the request do not have to be carri out in a fix order and the agent (the satellit) do not have ani physic interact. carri out a request cannot prevent anoth agent from carri out anoth on, even the same on. at most, there will be a wast of resourc. formal, a swarm is defin as follow: definit 1 (swarm). a satellit swarm e is a  triplet < s, t, vicin >: - s is a set of n agent {s1 . . . sn}; - t ⊆ r+ or n+ is a set of date with a total order <; - vicin : s × t → 2s . in the sequel, we will assum that the agent share a  common clock. for a given agent and a given time, the vicin relat return the set of agent with whom it can commun at that time. as we have seen previous, thi relat exist when the agent meet. 1 thi term will design a satellit constel with  intersatellit link. 3.2 request request ar the observ task that the satellit swarm must achiev. as we have seen previous, the request ar gener both on the ground and on board. each agent is alloc a set of initi request. dure the mission, new request ar sent to the agent by the ground or agent can gener new request by themselv. formal, a request is defin as follow: definit 2 (request). a request r is defin as a tupl < idr, po(r), prio(r), tbeg(r),br >: - idr is an identifi; - po(r) is the geograph posit of r; - prio(r) ∈ r is the request prioriti; - tbeg(r) ∈ t is the desir date of observ; - br ∈ {true, fals} specifi if r ha been realiz. the prioriti prio(r) of a request repres how much it is import for the user, name the request sender, that the request should be carri out. thu a request with a high prioriti must be realiz at all cost. in our applic, prioriti ar compris between 1 and 5 (the highest). in the sequel, we will note rt si the set of the request that ar known by agent si at time t ∈ t. for each request r in rt si , there is a cost valu, note costsi (r) ∈ r, repres how far from the desir date of observ tbeg(r) an agent si can realiz r. so, the more an agent can carri out a request in the vicin of the desir date of observ, the lower the cost valu. 3.3 candidaci an agent mai have sever intent about a request, i.e. for a request r, an agent si mai: - propos to carri out r : si mai realiz r; - commit to carri out r : si will realiz r; - not propos to carri out r : si mai not realiz r; - refus to carri out r : si will not realiz r. we can notic that these four proposit ar modal of proposit c: si realiz r: - 3c mean that si propos to carri out r; - 2c mean that si commit to carri out r; - ¬3c mean that si doe not propos to carri out r; - ¬2c mean that si refus to carri out r. more formal: definit 3 (candidaci). a candidaci c is a tupl < idc , modc, sc , rc , obsc, dnlc >: - idc is an identifi; - modc ∈ {3, 2, ¬3, ¬2} is a modal; - sc ∈ s is the candid agent; - rc ∈ rt sc is the request on which sc candid; - obsc ∈ t is the realiz date propos by sc ; - dnlc ∈ t is the download date. 3.4 problem formal then, our problem is the follow: we would like each agent to build request alloc (i.e a plan) dynam such as if these request ar carri out their number is the highest possibl or the global cost is minim. more formal, definit 4 (problem). let e be a swarm. agent si in e must build a set {at s1 . . . at sn } where at si ⊆ rt si such 288 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) as: - | s si∈s at si | is maxim;  p si∈s p r∈at si prio(r) is maxim.  p si∈s p r∈at si costsi (r) is minim. let us notic that these criteria ar not necessarili  compat. as the choic of an agent will be influenc by the choic of the other, it is necessari that the agent should reason on a common knowledg about the request. it is thu  necessari to set up an effect commun protocol. 4. commun protocol commun is commonli associ with cooper. delib agent need commun to cooper,  wherea it is not necessarili the case for reactiv agent [2, 41]. gossip protocol [22, 24], or epidem protocol, ar us to share knowledg with multicast. each agent select a set of agent at a given time in order to share inform. the speed of inform transmiss is conting upon the length of the discuss round. 4.1 the corridor metaphor the suggest protocol is inspir from what we name the corridor metaphor, which repres well the satellit swarm problem. variou agent go to and fro in a corridor where object to collect appear from time to time. two object that ar too close to each other cannot be collect by the same agent becaus the action take some time and an agent cannot stop it movement. in order to optim the collect, the agent can commun when thei meet. s 2 s abel a 1 a 3s figur 1: time t 1 s 2s bel non a 3s figur 2: time t exampl 1. let us suppos three agent, s1, s2, s3 and an object a to be collect. at time t, s1 did not collect a and s2 doe not know that a exist. when s1 meet s2, it commun the list of the object it know, that is to sai a. s2 now believ that a exist and prepar to collect it. it is not certain that a is still there becaus anoth agent mai have pass befor s2, but it can take it into account in it plan. at time t , s3 collect a. in the vicin of s2, s3  commun it list of object and a is not in the list. as both agent meet in a place where it is possibl for s3 to have collect a, the object would have been in the list if it had not been collect. s2 can thu believ that a doe not exist anymor and can withdraw it from it plan. 4.2 knowledg to commun in order to build up their plan, agent need to know the current request and the other agent" intent. for each agent two kind of knowledg to maintain ar defin: - request (definit 2); - candidaci (definit 3). definit 5 (knowledg). knowledg k is a tupl < data(k), sk , tk >: - data(k) is a request r or a candidaci c; - sk ⊆ s is the set of agent know k; - tk ∈ t is a tempor timestamp. in the sequel, we will note kt si the knowledg of agent si at time t ∈ t. 4.3 an epidem protocol from the corridor metaphor, we can defin a  commun protocol that benefit from all the commun  opportun. an agent notifi ani chang within it  knowledg and each agent must propag these chang to it vicin who updat their knowledg base and reiter the process. thi protocol is a variant of epidem protocol [22] inspir from the work on overhear [27]. protocol 1 (commun). let si be an agent in s. ∀t ∈ t: - ∀ sj ∈ vicin(si, t), si execut: 1. ∀ k ∈ kt si such as sj ∈ sk : a. si commun k to sj b. if sj acknowledg receipt of k, sk ← sk ∪ {sj}. - ∀ k ∈ kt si receiv by sj at time t: 1. sj updat kt sj with k 2. sj acknowledg receipt of k to si. two kind of updat exist for an agent: - an intern updat from a knowledg modif by the agent itself; - an extern updat from receiv knowledg. for an intern updat, updat k depend on data(k): a candidaci c is modifi when it modal chang and a request r is modifi when an agent realiz it. when k is updat, the timestamp is updat too. protocol 2 (intern updat). let si ∈ s be an agent. an intern updat from si at time t ∈ t is  perform: - when knowledg k is creat; - when data(k) is modifi. in both case: 1. tk ← t; 2. sk ← {si}. for an extern updat, onli the most recent knowledg k is taken into account becaus timestamp chang onli when data(k) is modifi. if k is alreadi known, it is updat if the content or the set of agent know it have been modifi. if k is unknown, it is simpli ad to the agent"s knowledg. protocol 3 (extern updat). let si be an agent and k the knowledg transmit by agent sj. ∀ k ∈ k, the extern updat at time t ∈ t is defin as follow: 1. if ∃ k ∈ kt si such as iddata(k) = iddata(k ) then a. if tk ≥ tk then i. if tk > tk then sk ← sk ∪ {si} ii. if tk = tk then sk ← sk ∪ sk iii. kt si ← (kt si \{k }) ∪ {k} 2. els a. kt si ← kt si ∪ {k} b. sk ← sk ∪ {si} the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 289 if the incom inform ha a more recent timestamp, it mean that the receiv agent ha obsolet inform. consequ, it replac the old inform by the new on and add itself to the set of agent know k (1.a.i). if both timestamp ar the same, both piec of  inform ar the same. onli the set of the agent know k mai have chang becaus agent si and sj mai have alreadi transmit the inform to other agent.  consequ, the set of agent know k ar unifi (1.a.ii). 4.4 properti commun between two agent when thei meet is made of the conjunct of protocol 1 and protocol 3. in the sequel, we call thi conjunct a commun occurr. 4.4.1 converg the structur of the transmit inform and the  intern updat mechan (protocol 2) allow the process to converg. inde, a request r can onli be in two state (realiz or not) given by the boolean br. onc an intern updat is made - i.e. r is realiz - r cannot go back to it former state. consequ, an intern updat can onli be perform onc. as far as candidaci ar concern, updat onli modifi the modal, which mai chang mani time and go back to previou state. then it seem that livelock2 would be like to appear. howev, a candidaci c is associ to a request and a realiz date (the deadlin given by obsc ). after the deadlin, the candidaci becom meaningless. thu for each candidaci, there exist a date t ∈ t when chang will propag no more. 4.4.2 complex it ha been shown that in a set of n agent where a  singl on ha a new piec of inform, an epidem protocol take o(logn) step to broadcast the inform [33].  dure on step, each agent ha a commun occurr. as agent do not have much time to commun, such a commun occurr must not have a too big tempor complex, which we can prove formal: proposit 1. the tempor complex of a  commun occurr at time t ∈ t between two agent si and sj is, for agent si, o(|rt si |.|rt sj |.|s|2 ) proof 1. for the worst case, each agent sk send |rt sk | piec of inform on request and |rt sk |.|s| piec of  inform on candidaci (on candidaci for each request and for each agent of the swarm). let si and sj two agent meet at time t ∈ t. for agent si, the complex of  protocol 1 is o(|rt si | + |rt si |.|s| | {z } emiss + |rt sj | + |rt sj |.|s| | {z } recept ) for each receiv piec of inform, agent si us protocol 3 and search through it knowledg base: |rt si | piec of inform for each receiv request and |rt si |.|s| piec of 2 commun endlessli without converg. inform for each receiv candidaci. consequ, the complex of protocol 3 is o(|rt sj |.|rt si | + |rt sj |.|rt si |.|s|2 ) thu, the tempor complex of a commun  occurr is: o(|rt si | + |rt si |.|s| + |rt sj |.|rt si | + |rt sj |.|rt si |.|s|2 )) then: o(|rt si |.|rt sj |.|s|2 ) 5. on-board plan in space context, [5, 21, 6] present multi-agent  architectur for on-board plan. howev, thei assum high commun and comput capabl [10]. [13] relax these constraint by cleav plan modul: on the first hand, satellit have a planner that build plan on a larg horizon and on the second hand, thei have a decis  modul that enabl them to choos to realiz or not a plan observ. in an uncertain environ such as the on of satellit swarm, it mai be advantag to delai the decis until the last moment (i.e. the realiz date), especi if there ar sever possibl for a given request. the main idea in conting plan [15, 29] is to determin the node in the initi plan where the risk of failur ar most import and to increment build conting branch for these situat. 5.1 a delib approach inspir from both approach, we propos to build  alloc made up of a set of unquestion request and a set of uncertain disjunct request on which a decis will be made at the end of the decis horizon. thi  horizon correspond to the request realiz date. propos such partial alloc allow conflict to be solv local without propag them through the whole plan. in order to build the agent" initi plan, let us assum that each agent is equip with an on-board planner. a plan is defin as follow: definit 6 (plan). let si be an agent, rt si a set of request and ct si a set of candidaci. let us defin three set: - the set of potenti request: rp = {r ∈ rt si |br = fals} - the set of mandatori request: rm = {r ∈ rp |∃c ∈ ct si : modc = 2, sc = si, rc = r} - the set of given-up request: rg = {r ∈ rp |∃c ∈ ct si : modc = ¬2, sc = si, rc = r} a plan at si gener at time t ∈ t is a set of request such as rm ⊆ at si ⊆ rp and ∃ r ∈ rg such as r ∈ at si . build a plan gener candidaci. definit 7 (gener candidaci). let si be an agent and at1 si a (possibl empti) plan at time t1. let at2 si be the plan gener at time t2 with t2 > t1. - ∀ r ∈ at1 si such as r ∈ at2 si , a candidaci c such as mod(c) = ¬3, sc = si and rc = r is gener; - ∀ r ∈ at2 si such as r ∈ at1 si , a candidaci c such as mod(c) = 3, sc = si and rc = r is gener; - protocol 2 is us to updat kt1 si in kt2 si . 290 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 5.2 conflict when two agent compar their respect plan some conflict mai appear. it is a matter of redund between alloc on a given request, i.e.: sever agent stand as candid to carri out thi request. wherea such  redund mai sometim be us to ensur the realiz of a request (the realiz mai fail, e.g. becaus of cloud), it mai also lead to a loss of opportun. consequ, conflict ha to be defin: definit 8 (conflict). let si and sj be two agent with, at time t, candidaci csi and csj respect (scsi = si and scsj = sj). si and sj ar in conflict if and onli if: - rcsi = rcsj - modcsi and modcsj ∈ {2, 3} let us notic that the agent have the mean to know whether thei ar in conflict with anoth on dure the commun process. inde, thei exchang inform not onli concern their own plan but also concern what thei know about the other agent" plan. all the conflict do not have the same strength, mean that thei can be solv with more or less difficulti accord to the agent" commun capac. a conflict is soft when the concern agent can commun befor on or the other carri out the request in question. a conflict is hard when the agent cannot commun befor the  realiz of the request. definit 9 (soft/hard conflict). let si and sj (i < j) two agent in conflict with, at time t, candidaci csi and csj respect (scsi = si and scsj = sj). if ∃ v ⊆ s such as v = {si . . . sj} and if ∃ t ∈ t such as t = {ti−1 . . . tj−1} (ti−1 = t) where: ∀ i ≤ k <j, sk+1 ∈ vicin(sk, tk) with tk < obscsi , tk < obscsj and tk ≥ tk−1 then the conflict is soft els it is hard. a conflict is soft if it exist a chain of agent between the two agent in conflict such as inform can propag  befor both agent realiz the request. if thi chain doe not exist, it mean that the agent in conflict cannot  commun directli or not. consequ, the conflict is hard. in satellit swarm, the geograph posit of the  request ar known as well as the satellit orbit. so each agent is abl to determin if a conflict is soft or hard. we can defin the conflict cardin: definit 10 (conflict cardin). let si be an agent and r a request in conflict. the conflict cardin is cardc(r) = |{c ∈ ct si |modc ∈ {2, 3}, cr = r}|. the conflict cardin correspond to the number of agent that ar candid or commit to the same request. thu, a conflict ha at least a cardin of 2. 6. collabor strategi in space context, commun time and agent"  comput capac ar limit. when thei ar in conflict, the agent must find a local agreement (instead of an expens global agreement) by us the conflict in order to increas the number of realiz request, to decreas the time of  mission return, to increas the qualiti of the pictur taken or to make sure that a request is carri out. exampl 2. let us suppos a conflict on request r  between agent si and sj. we would like that the most expert agent, i.e. the agent that can carri out the request under the best condit, doe it. let us suppos si is the expert. si must alloc r to itself. it remain to determin what sj must do: sj can either select a substitut for r in order to increas the number of request potenti realiz, or do noth in order to preserv resourc, or alloc r to itself to ensur redund. consequ, we can defin collabor strategi  dedic to conflict solv. a strategi is a privat (name intrins to an agent) decis process that allow an agent to make a decis on a given object. in our applic, strategi specifi what to do with redund. 6.1 cost and expertis in our applic, cost is link to the realiz date. carri out a request consum the agent" resourc (e.g.: on-board energi, memori). consequ, an observ ha a cost for each agent which depend on when it is  realiz: the closer the realiz date to the desir date of observ, the lower the cost. definit 11 (cost). let si be an agent. the cost costsi (rc ) ∈ r to carri out a request rc accord to a candidaci c is defin as: costsi (rc ) = |obsc − tbeg(rc)|. from thi cost notion, we can formal defin an expert  notion between two agent. the expertis for an agent mean it can realiz the request at the lower cost. definit 12 (expertis). let si and sj ∈ s be two agent and r a request. agent si is an expert for r if and onli if costsi (r) ≤ costsj (r). 6.2 soft conflict solv strategi three strategi ar propos to solv a conflict. the  expert strategi mean that the expert agent maintain it  candidaci wherea the other on give up. the altruist strategi mean that the agent that can download first3 , provid the cost increas is neglig, maintain it candidaci wherea the other on give up. the insur strategi mean that both agent maintain their candidaci in order to ensur redund. strategi 1 (expert). let si and sj be two agent in conflict on their respect candidaci csi and csj such as si is the expert agent. the expert strategi is: modcsi = 2 and modcsj = ¬2. strategi 2 (altruist). let si and sj be two agent in conflict on their respect candidaci csi and csj such as si is the expert agent. let ∈ r+ be a threshold on the cost increas. the altruist strategi is : if dnlcsi > dnlcsj and |costsi (r) − costsj (r)| < then modcsi = ¬2 and modcsj = 2. strategi 3 (insur). let si and sj be two agent in conflict on their respect candidaci csi and csj such as si is the expert agent. let α ∈ r be a prioriti threshold. the insur strategi is : if prio(r) cardc(r)−1 > α then modcsi = 3 and modcsj = 3. 3 i.e. the agent us memori resourc dure a shorter time. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 291 in the insur strategi, redund trigger is  adjust by the conflict cardin cardc(r). the reason is the follow: the more redund on a given request, the less a new redund on thi request is need. the three strategi ar implement in a negoti  protocol dedic to soft conflict. the protocol is base on a subsumpt architectur [7] on strategi: the insur strategi (1) is the major strategi becaus it ensur  redund for which the swarm is implement. then the  altruist strategi come (2) in order to alloc the resourc so as to enhanc the mission return. final, the expert strategi that doe not have precondit (3) enhanc the cost of the plan. protocol 4 (soft conflict solv). let r be a request in a soft conflict between two agent, si and sj. these agent have csi and csj for respect candidaci. let si be the expert agent. agent appli strategi as  follow: 1. insur strategi (α) 2. altruist strategi ( ) 3. expert strategi the choic of paramet α and allow to adjust the protocol result. for exampl, if = 0, the altruist strategi is never us. 6.3 hard conflict solv strategi in case of a hard conflict, the agent that is not awar will necessarili realiz the request (with success or not).  consequ, a redund is us onli if the other agent is more expert or if the prioriti of the request is high enough to need redund. therefor, we will us the insur  strategi (refer to section 6.2) and defin a competit strategi. the latter is defin for two agent, si and sj, in a hard conflict on a request r. let si be the agent that is awar of the conflict4 . strategi 4 (competit). let λ ∈ r+ be an cost threshold. the competit strategi is: if costsi (r) < costsj (r) − λ then modcsi = 3. protocol 5 (hard conflict solv). let si be an agent in a hard conflict with an agent sj on a request r. si appli strategi as follow: 1. insur strategi (α) 2. competit strategi (λ) 3. withdraw : modcsi = ¬2 6.4 gener although agent us pair commun, thei mai have inform about sever agent and conflict cardin mai be more than 2. therefor, we defin a k-conflict as a conflict with a cardin of k on a set of agent  propos or commit to realiz the same request. formal, definit 13 (k-conflict). let s = {s1 . . . sk} be a set of agent with respect candidaci cs1 . . . csk at time t. the set s is in a k-conflict if and onli if: - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, scsi = si; - !∃r such as ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, rcsi = r; 4 i.e. the agent that must make a decis on r. - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, modcsi ∈ {2, 3}. - s is maxim (⊆) among the set that satisfi these properti. as previous, a k-conflict can be soft or hard. a k-conflict is soft if each pair conflict in the k-conflict is a soft conflict with respect to definit 9. as conflict bear on set of agent, expertis is a total order on agent. we defin rank-i-expertis where the  concern agent is the ith expert. in case of a soft k-conflict, the rank-i-expert agent make it decis with respect to the rank-(i + 1)-expert agent accord to protocol 4. the protocol is appli recurs and α and paramet ar updat at each step in order to avoid cost explos5 . in case of a hard conflict, the set s of agent in conflict can be split in ss (the subset of agent in a soft conflict) and sh (the subset of unawar agent). onli agent in ss can take a decis and must adapt themselv to agent in sh . the rank-i-expert agent in ss us protocol 5 on the whole set sh and the rank-(i − 1)-expert agent in ss . if an agent in ss appli the competit strategi all the other withdraw. 7. experi satellit swarm simul have been implement in  java with the jade platform [3]. the on-board planner is implement with linear program us ilog cplex [1]. the simul scenario implement 3 satellit on  6hour orbit. two scenario have been consid: the first on with a set of 40 request with low mutual exclus and conflict rate and the second on with a set of 74 request with high mutual exclus and conflict rate. for each scenario, six simul have been perform: on with central plan (all request ar plan by the ground station befor the simul), on where agent ar isol (thei cannot commun nor coordin with on anoth), on inform simul (agent onli  commun request) and three other simul implement the instanci collabor strategi (polit): - neutral polit: α, and λ ar set to averag valu; - drastic polit: α and λ ar set to higher valu, i.e. agent will ensur redund onli if the prioriti ar high and, in case of a hard conflict, if the cost payoff is much higher; - lax polit: α is set to a lower valu, i.e. redund ar more frequent. in the case of low mutual exclus and conflict rate  (tabl 1), central and isol simul lead to the same number of observ, with the same averag prioriti. isol lead to a lower cost is due to the high  number of redund: mani agent carri out the same  request at differ cost. the inform simul reduc the number of redund but sligthli increas the  averag cost for the same reason. we can notic that the us of 5 for instanc, the rank-1-expert agent withdraw due to the altruist strategi and the cost increas by in the worst case, then rank-2-expert agent withdraw

the number of redund to be much more reduc but the number of observ decreas ow to the constraint creat by commit. furthermor, the averag cost is increas too. nevertheless each avoid redund correspond to save resourc to realiz on-board gener request dure the simul. in the case of high mutual exclus and conflict rate  (tabl 2), noteworthi differ exist between the central and isol simul. we can notic that all inform simul (with or without strategi) allow to perform more observ than isol agent do with less  redund. likewis, we can notic that all polit reduc the averag cost contrari to the first scenario. the drastic  polit is interest becaus not onli doe it allow to perform more observ than isol agent do but it allow to highli reduc the averag cost with the lowest number of redund. as far as the number of exchang messag is concern, there ar 12 meet between 2 agent dure the  simul. in the worst case, at each meet each agent send n piec of inform on the request plu 3n piec of inform on the agent" intent plu 1 messag for the end of commun, where n is the total number of  request. consequ, 3864 messag ar exchang in the worst case for the 40-request simul and 7128 messag for the 74-request simul. these number ar much higher than the number of messag that ar actual  exchang. we can notic that the inform simul, that commun onli request, allow a higher reduct. in the gener case, us commun and strategi allow to reduc redund and save resourc but  increas the averag cost: if a request is realiz, agent that know it do not plan it even if it cost can be reduc  afterward. it is not the case with isol agent. us strategi on littl constrain problem such as scenario 1 constrain the agent too much and caus an addit cost increas. strategi ar more us on highli constrain problem such as scenario 2. although agent constrain themselv on the number of observ, the averag cost is wide reduc. 8. conclus and futur work an observ satellit swarm is a cooper  multiag system with strong constraint in term of  commun and comput capabl. in order to increas the global mission outcom, we propos an hybrid approach: delib for individu plan and reactiv for  collabor. agent reason both on request to carri out and on the other agent" intent (candidaci). an epidem  commun protocol us all commun opportun to updat thi inform. reactiv decis rule  (strategi) ar propos to solv conflict that mai aris between agent. through the tune of the strategi (α, and λ) and their plastic interlac within the protocol, it is  possibl to coordin agent without addit commun: the number of exchang messag remain nearli the same between inform simul and simul implement strategi. some simul have been made to experiment  valid these protocol and the first result ar promis but rais mani question. what is the trade-off between the constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategi? to what extent ar the number of redund and the  averag cost affect by the tune of the strategi? futur work will focu on new strategi to solv new conflict, special those aris when relax the  independ assumpt between the request. a second point is to take into account the complex of the initi plan problem. inde, the chosen plan approach result in a combinatori explos with big set of request: an anytim or a fulli reactiv approach ha to be consid for more complex problem. acknowledg we would like to thank mari-clair
