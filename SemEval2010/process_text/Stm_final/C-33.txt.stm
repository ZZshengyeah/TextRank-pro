 challeng problem in context-awar comput. most exist approach us a central select mechan to decid which context inform is appropri. in thi paper, we propos a novel approach base on negoti with reward to solv such problem. distribut context provid  negoti with each other to decid who can provid context and how thei alloc proce. in order to support our approach, we have design a concret negoti model with reward. we also evalu our approach and show that it inde can choos an appropri context provid and alloc the proce fairli. categori and subject descriptor c.2.4 [distribut system]: distribut  applicationsprovid context inform gener term context 1. introduct context-awar is a kei concept in pervas  comput. context inform both recognit and map by  provid a structur, unifi view of the world in which the system oper [1]. context-awar applic exploit  context inform, such as locat, prefer of user and so on, to adapt their behavior in respons to chang  requir of user and pervas environ. howev, on specif kind of context can often be provid by  differ context provid (sensor or other data sourc of  context inform) with differ qualiti level. for exampl, in a smart home, thermomet a"s measur precis is 0.1 ◦ c, and thermomet b"s measur precis is 0.5 ◦ c. thu a could provid more precis context  inform about temperatur than b. moreov, sometim differ context provid mai provid conflict context inform. for exampl, differ sensor report that the same person is in differ place at the same time.  becaus context-awar applic util context inform to adapt their behavior, inappropri context inform mai lead to inappropri behavior. thu we should design a mechan to provid appropri context inform for current context-awar applic. in pervas environ, context provid consid as rel independ entiti, have their own interest. thei hope to get proce when thei provid context  inform. howev, most exist approach consid context provid as entiti without ani person interest, and us a central arbitr provid by the middlewar to  decid who can provid appropri context. thu the burden of the middlewar is veri heavi, and it decis mai be unfair and harm some provid" interest. moreov, when such arbitr is broken down, it will caus seriou  consequ for context-awar applic. in thi paper, we let distribut context provid themselv decid who  provid context inform. sinc high reput could help provid get more opportun to provid context and get more proce in the futur, provid try to get the right to provid good context to enhanc their reput. in order to get such right, context provid mai agre to share some portion of the proce with it oppon. thu  context provid negoti with each other to reach agreement on the issu who can provid context and how thei alloc the proce. our approach ha some specif advantag: 1. we do not need an arbitr provid by the  middlewar of pervas comput to decid who provid context. thu it will reduc the burden of the  middlewar. 2. it is more reason that distribut context provid decid who provid context, becaus it can avoid the seriou consequ caus by a breakdown of a  central arbitr. 3. it can guarante provid" interest and provid fair proce alloc when provid negoti with each other to reach agreement on their concern problem. 4. thi approach can choos an appropri provid  automat. it doe not need ani applic and user" intervent. the negoti model we have design to support our  approach is also a novel model in negoti domain. thi model can help negoti reach agreement in the present negoti process by provid some guarante over the outcom of next negoti process (i.e. reward).  negoti mai find current offer and reward worth more than counter-offer which will delai the agreement, and accept current offer and reward. without the reward, it mai find current offer worth less than the counter-offer, and propos it counter-offer. it will cost more time to reach agreement. it also expand the negoti space consid in present negoti process, and therefor provid more  possibl to find better agreement. the remaind of thi paper is organ as follow.  section 2 present some assumpt. section 3 describ our approach base on negoti detailedli, includ  util function, negoti protocol and context provid" strategi. section 4 evalu our approach. in section 5 we introduc some relat work and conclud in section 6. 2. some assumpt befor introduc our approach, we would like to give some assumpt: 1. all context provid ar well-mean and honest. dure the negoti process, thei exchang  inform honestli. reward confirm in thi  negoti process will be fulfil in the next negoti process. 2. all provid must guarante the system"s interest. thei should provid appropri context inform for current applic. after guarante the  system"s interest, thei can try to maxim their own  person interest. the assumpt is reason, becaus when an inappropri context provid get the right to provid bad context, as a punish, it  reput will decreas, and the proce is also veri small. 3. as context provid ar independ, factor which influenc their negoti stanc and behavior ar  privat and not avail to their oppon. their util function ar also privat. 4. sinc the negoti take place in pervas  environ, time is a critic factor. the current  applic often hope to get context inform as quickli as possibl, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possibl. context provid often have strict deadlin by when the negoti must be  complet. after present these assumpt, we will propos our  approach base on negoti with reward in the next  section. 3. our approach in the begin, we introduc the concept of reput and qualiti of context (qoc) attribut. both will be us in our approach. reput of an agent is a percept  regard it behavior norm, which is held by other agent, base on experi and observ of it past action [7]. here agent mean context provid. each provid"s  reput indic it histor abil to provid appropri context inform. qualiti of context (qoc) attribut character the qualiti of context inform. when  applic requir context inform, thei should specifi their qoc requir which express constraint of qoc attribut. context provid can specifi qoc attribut for the context inform thei deliv. although we can decid who provid appropri context accord to qoc requir and context provid" qoc inform,  applic" qoc requir might not reflect the actual qualiti requir. thu, in addit to qoc, reput inform of context provid is anoth factor affect the decis who can provid context inform. negoti is a process by which a joint decis is made by two or more parti. the parti first verbal  contradictori demand and then move toward agreement by a  process of concess make or search for new altern [2]. in pervas environ, all avail context provid negoti with each other to decid who can provid  context inform. thi process will be repeat becaus a kind of context is need more than on time.  negoti us persuas argument (such as threat, promis of futur reward, and appeal) allow negoti parti to influenc each other" prefer to reach better deal effect and effici [9]. thi pervas negoti is effect in repeat interact becaus argument can be construct to directli impact futur encount. in thi paper, for simplic, we let negoti take place between two provid. we extend raiffa"s basic model for bilater negoti [8], and allow negoti to negoti with each other by exchang argument in the form of promis of  futur reward or request for futur reward. reward mean some extra proce in the next negoti process. thei can influenc outcom of current and futur negoti. in our approach, as describ by figur 1, the current applic requir context manag to provid a specif type of context inform satisfi qoc requir. context manag find that provid a and b can provid such kind of context with differ qualiti level. then the manag tell a and b to negoti to reach agreement on who can provid the context inform and how thei will alloc the proce. both provid get reput  inform from the databas reput of context provid and qoc requir, and then negoti with each other accord to our negoti model. when negoti is complet, the chosen provid will provid the context  inform to context manag, and then context manag deliv such inform to the applic and also store it in context knowledg base where current and histor context inform is store. the current applic give the feedback inform about the provid context, and then context manag will updat the chosen provid"s  reput inform accord to the feedback inform. context manag also provid the proce to provid accord to the feedback inform and the time cost on negoti. in the follow part of thi section, we describ our negoti model in detail, includ context provid" util function to evalu offer and reward, negoti protocol, and strategi to gener offer and reward. context knowledg base reput of context provid context provid a context manag negoti applic"s qoc requir and feedback provid qoc requir and proce manag context provid context getreput getreput updat reput inform accord to feedback context provid b figur 1: negoti to provid appropri context inform. 3.1 util function dure the negoti process, on provid propos an offer and a reward to the other provid. an offer is note as o = (c, p): c indic the chosen context provid and it domain is dc (i.e. the two context provid particip in the negoti); p mean the propos"s portion of the proce, and it domain is dp = [0,1]. it oppon"s  portion of the proce is 1−p. the reward ep"s domain is dep = [-1,1], and |ep| mean the extra portion of proce the propos promis to provid or request in the next  negoti process. ep < 0 mean the propos promis to provid reward, ep > 0 mean the propos request reward and ep =0 mean no reward. the oppon evalu the offer and reward to decid to accept them or propos a counter-offer and a reward. thu context provid should have util function to evalu offer and reward. time is a critic factor, and onli at time in the set t = {0, 1, 2, . . . tdeadlin}, context provid can propos their offer. the set o includ all avail offer.  context provid a"s util function of the offer and reward at time t ua : o × dep × t → [−1, 1] is defin as: ua(o,ep,t)=(wa 1 ·ua c (c)+wa 2 ·ua p (p)+wa 3 ·ua ep(ep))·δa(t) (1) similarli, the util function of a"s oppon (i.e. b) can be defin as: ub(o,ep,t)=(wb 1 ·ub c (c)+wb 2 ·ub p (1−p)+wb 3 ·ub ep(−ep))·δb(t) in (1), wa 1 , wa 2 and wa 3 ar weight given to c, p and ep respect, and wa 1 + wa 2 + wa 3 =1. usual, the context provid pai the most attent to the system"s interest, pai the least attent to the reward, thu wa 1 > wa 2 > wa 3 . ua c : dc → [−1, 1] is the util function of the issu who provid context. thi function is determin by two  factor: the distanc between c"s qoc and current applic"s qoc requir, and c"s reput. the two  negoti acquir c"s qoc inform from c, and we us the approach propos in [4] to calcul the distanc between c"s qoc and the applic"s qoc requir. the  requir context ha n qoc attribut and let the  applic"s wish for thi context be a = (a1, a2 . . . an) (where ai = mean the applic"s indiffer to the i-th qoc attribut), c"s qoc attribut cp = (cp1, cp2 . . . cpn) (where cpi = mean c"s inabl to provid a quantit valu for the i-th qoc attribut). becaus numer distanc  valu of differ properti ar combin, e.g. locat  precis in metr with refresh rate in hz, thu a standard scale for all dimens is need. the scale factor for the qoc attribut ar s = (s1, s2 . . . sn). in addit, differ qoc attribut mai have differ weight: w = (w1, w2 . . . wn). then d = (d1, d2 . . . dn) di = (cpi − ai) · si · wi where cpi−ai = 0 for ai = and cpi−ai = o(ai) for cpi = ( o(.) determin the applic"s satisfact or  dissatisfact when c is unabl to provid an estim of a qoc  attribut, given the valu wish for by the applic). the distanc can be linear distanc (1-norm), euclidean distanc (2-norm), or the maximum distanc (max-norm): |d| = |d1| + |d2| + . . . + |dn| (1 − norm) ||d||2 = |d1|2 + |d2|2 + . . . + |dn|2 (2 − norm) ||d||∞ = max{|d1|, |d2| . . . |dn|} (max − norm) the detail descript of thi calcul can be found in [4]. reput of c can be acquir from the databas  reput of context provid. ua c (c) : r × drep → [−1, 1] can be defin as: ua c (c) = wa c1 · ua d (d) + wa c2 · ua rep(rep) wa c1 and wa c2 ar weight given to the distanc and  reput respect, and wa c1 + wa c2 = 1. drep is the domain of reput inform. ua d : r → [0, 1] is a  monotonedecreas function and ua rep : drep → [−1, 1] is a  monotoneincreas function. ua p : dp → [0, 1] is the util function of the portion of proce a will receiv and it is also a monoton-increas function. a"s util function of reward ep ua ep : dep → [−1, 1] is also a monoton-increas  function and ua ep(0) = 0. δa : t → [0, 1] is the time discount function. it is also a monoton-decreas function. when time t cost on negoti increas, δa(t) will decreas, and the util will also decreas. thu both negoti want to reach agreement as quickli as possibl to avoid loss of util. 3.2 negoti protocol when provid a and b have got qoc requir and reput inform, thei begin to negoti. thei first set their reserv (the lowest accept) util which can guarante the system"s interest and their person  interest. when the context provid find the util of an offer and a reward is lower than it reserv util, it will reject thi propos and termin the negoti process. the provid who start the negoti is chosen randomli. we assum a start the negoti, and it propos offer o and reward ep to b accord to it strategi (see subsect 3.3). when b receiv the propos from a, it us it util  function to evalu it. if it is lower than it reserv util, the provid termin the negoti. otherwis, if ub(o, ep, t) ≥ ub(o , ep , t + 1) i.e. the util of o and ep propos by a at time t is greater than the util of offer o" and reward ep" which b will  propos to a at time t + 1, b will accept thi offer and reward. the negoti is complet. howev, if ub(o, ep, t) < ub(o , ep , t + 1) then b will reject a"s propos, and propos it counter-offer and reward to a. when a receiv b"s counter-offer and  reward, a evalu them us it util function, and  compar the util with the util of offer and reward it want to propos to b at time t+2, decid to accept it or give it counter-offer and reward. thi negoti process continu and in each negoti round, context provid conced in order to reach agreement. the negoti will be  successfulli finish when agreement is reach, or be termin forcibl due to deadlin or the util lower than reserv util. when negoti is forc to be termin,  context manag will ask a and b to calcul ua c (a), ua c (b), ub c (a) and ub c (b) respect. if ua c (a) + ub c (a) > ua c (b) + ub c (b) context manag let a provid context. if ua c (a) + ub c (a) < ua c (b) + ub c (b) then b will get the right to provid context inform. when ua c (a) + ub c (a) = ua c (b) + ub c (b) context manag will select a provid from a and b  randomli. in addit, context manag alloc the  proce between the two provid. although we can select on provid when negoti is termin forcibl,  howev, thi mai lead to the unfair alloc of the proce. moreov, more time negoti cost on negoti, less proce will be given. thu negoti will try to reach agreement as soon as possibl in order to avoid unnecessari loss. when the negoti is finish, the chosen provid  provid the context inform to context manag which will deliv the inform to current applic.  accord to the applic"s feedback inform about thi  context, context manag updat the provid"s reput store in reput of context provid. the provid"s reput mai be enhanc or decreas. in addit, accord to the feedback and the negoti time,  context manag will give proce to the provid. then the provid will share the proce with it oppon accord to the negoti outcom and the reward confirm in the last negoti process. for exampl, in the last  negoti process a promis to give reward ep (0 ≤ ep < 1) to b, and a"s portion of the proce is p in current  negoti. then a"s actual portion of the proce is p · (1 − ep), and it oppon b"s portion of the proce is 1−p+p·ep. 3.3 negoti strategi the context provid might want to pursu the right to provid context inform blindli in order to enhanc it reput. howev when it final provid bad context inform, it reput will be decreas and the  proce is also veri small. thu the context provid should take action accord to it strategi. the aim of provid"s negoti strategi is to determin the best cours of action which will result in a negoti outcom maxim it util function (i.e how to gener an offer and a reward). in our negoti model, the context provid gener it offer and reward accord to it perviou offer and reward and the last on sent by it oppon. at the begin of the negoti, context provid  initi their offer and reward accord to their belief and their reserv util. if context provid a consid that it can provid good context and want to enhanc  reput, then it will propos that a provid the context  inform, share some proce with it oppon b, and even promis to give reward. howev, if a consid that it mai provid bad context, a will propos that it  oppon b provid the context, and requir b to share some proce and provid reward. dure the negoti process, we assum that at time t a propos offer ot and reward ept to b, at time t + 1, b propos counter-offer ot+1 and reward ept+1 to a. then at time t + 2, when the util of b"s propos is greater than a"s reserv util, a give it respons. now we calcul the expect util to be conced at time t +2, we us cu to express the conced util. cu = (ua(ot, ept, t) − ua(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1)) · ca(t + 2) (ua(ot, ept, t) > ua(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1), otherwis, a will  accept b"s propos) where ca : t → [0, 1] is a  monotoneincreas function. ca(t) indic a"s util concess rate1 . a conced a littl in the begin befor conced significantli toward the deadlin. then a gener it  offer ot+2 = (ct+2, pt+2) and reward ept+2 at time t + 2. the expect util of a at time t + 2 is: ua(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) = ua(ot, ept, t + 2) − cu if ua(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) ≤ ua(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1) then a will accept b"s propos (i.e. ot+1 and ept+1).  otherwis, a will propos it counter-offer and reward base on cu. we assum that cu is distribut evenli on c, p and ep (i.e. the util to be conced on c, p and ep is 1 3 cu respect). if |ua c (ct)−(ua c (ct)− 1 3 cu δa(t+2) )| ≤ |ua c (ct+1)−(ua c (ct)− 1 3 cu δa(t+2) )| i.e. the expect util of c at time t+2 is ua c (ct)− 1 3 cu δa(t+2) and it is closer to the util of a"s propos ct at time t, then at time t + 2, ct+2 = ct, els the util is closer to b"propos ct+1 and ct+2 = ct+1. when ct+2 is equal to ct, the actual conced util of c is 0, and the total concess of p and ep is cu. we divid the total concess of p and ep evenli, and get the conced util of p and ep respect. we calcul pt+2 and ept+2 as follow: pt+2 = (ua p )−1 (ua p (pt) − 1 2 cu δa(t + 2) ) ept+2 = (ua ep)−1 (ua ep(ept) − 1 2 cu δa(t + 2) ) when ct+2 is equal to ct+1, the actual conced util of c is |ua c (ct+2) − ua c (ct)|, the total concess of p and ep is cu δa(t+2) − |ua c (ct+2) − ua c (ct)|, then: pt+2 = (ua p )−1 (ua p (pt)− 1 2 ( cu δa(t + 2) −|ua c (ct+2)−ua c (ct)|)) ept+2 = (ua ep)−1 (ua ep(ept)−1 2 ( cu δa(t+2) −|ua c (ct+2)−ua c (ct)|)) now, we have gener the offer and reward a will propos at time t + 2. similarli, b also can gener it offer and reward. 1 for exampl, ca(t) = ( t tdeadlin ) 1 β

tabl 1: util function and weight of c, p and ep for each provid 4. evalu in thi section, we evalu the effect of our  approach by simul experi. context provid a and b negoti to reach agreement. thei get qoc requir and calcul the distanc between qoc requir and their qoc. for simplic, in our experi, we assum that the distanc ha been calcul, and da repres distanc between qoc requir and a"s qoc, db  repres distanc between qoc requir and b"s qoc. the domain of da and db is [0,500]. we assum  reput valu is a real number and it domain is [-1000, 1000], repa repres a"s reput valu and repb repres b"s reput valu. we assum that both provid pai the most attent to the system"s interest, and pai the least attent to the reward, thu w1 > w2 > w3, and the weight of ud approxim the weight of urep. a and b"s util function and weight of c, p and ep ar defin in tabl 1. we set deadlin tdeadlin = 100, and defin time discount function δ(t) and concess rate function c(t) of a and b as follow: δa(t) = 0.9t δb(t) = 0.88t ca(t) = ( t tdeadlin ) 1 0.8 cb(t) = ( t tdeadlin ) 1 0.6 given differ valu of da, db, repa and repb, a and b negoti to reach agreement. the provid that start the negoti is chosen at random. we hope that when da db and repa repb, a will get the right to  provid context and get a major portion of the proce, and when ∆d = da − db is in a small rang (e.g. [-50,50]) and ∆rep = repa − repb is in a small rang (e.g. [-50,50]), a and b will get approxim equal opportun to provid context, and alloc the proce evenli. when da−db 500  approxim to da−db 1000 (i.e. the two provid" abil to provid context inform ar approxim equal), we also hope that a and b get equal opportun to provid context and alloc the proce evenli. accord to the three situat abov, we make three experi as follow: experi 1 : in thi experi, a and b negoti with each other for 50 time, and at each time, we assign  differ valu to da, db, repa, repb (satisfi da db and repa repb) and the reserv util of a and b. when the experi is complet, we find 3 negoti game ar termin due to the util lower than the reserv util. a get the right to provid context for 47 time. the averag portion of proce a get is about 0.683, and b"s averag portion of proce is 0.317. the averag time cost to reach agreement is 8.4. we also find that when b ask a to provid context in it first offer, b can requir and get more portion of the proce becaus of it goodwil. experi 2 : a and b also negoti with each other for 50 time in thi experi given differ valu of da, db, repa, repb (satisfi −50 ≤ ∆d = da − db ≤ 50 and −50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserv util of a and b. after the experi, we find that there ar 8  negoti game termin due to the util lower than the reserv util. a and b get the right to provid context for 20 time and 22 time respect. the averag portion of proce a get is 0.528 and b"s averag portion of the proce is 0.472. the averag time cost on negoti is 10.5. experi 3 : in thi experi, a and b also  negoti with each other for 50 time given da, db, repa, repb (satisfi −0.2 ≤ da−db 500 − da−db 1000 ≤ 0.2) and the reserv util of a and b. there ar 6 negoti game  termin forcibl. a and b get the right to provid context for 21 time and 23 time respect. the averag portion of proce a get is 0.481 and b"s averag portion of the proce is 0.519. the averag time cost on negoti is 9.2. on thing should be mention is that except for d, rep, p and ep, other factor (e.g. weight, time discount  function δ(t) and concess rate function c(t)) could also affect the negoti outcom. these factor should be adjust accord to provid" belief at the begin of each  negoti process. in our experi, for similar, we assign valu to them without ani particular in advanc. these experi" result prove that our approach can choos an appropri context provid and can provid a rel fair proce alloc. when on provid is obvious more appropri than the other provid, the provid will get the right to provid context and get a major portion of the proce. when both provid have the approxim same abil to provid context, their opportun to  provid context ar equal and thei can get about a half portion of the proce respect. 5. relat work in [4], huebscher and mccann have propos an adapt middlewar design for context-awar applic. their adapt middlewar us util function to choos the best context provid (given the qoc requir of  applic and the qoc of altern mean of context  acquisit). in our negoti model, the calcul of util function uc wa inspir by thi approach. henricksen and indulska propos an approach to model and us  imperfect inform in [3]. thei character variou type and sourc of imperfect context inform and present a set of novel context model construct. thei also outlin a  softwar infrastructur that support the manag and us of imperfect context inform. judd and steenkist in [5] describ a gener interfac to queri context servic  allow client to specifi their qualiti requir as bound on accuraci, confid, updat time and sampl interv. in [6], lei et al. present a context servic which accept fresh and confid meta-data from context sourc, and pass thi along to client so that thei can adjust their level of trust accordingli. [10] present a framework for  realiz dynam context consist manag. the  framework support inconsist detect base on a semant match and inconsist trigger model, and  inconsist resolut with proactiv action to context sourc. most approach to provid appropri context util a central arbitr. in our approach, we let distribut context provid themselv decid who can provid  appropri context inform. our approach can reduc the burden of the middlewar, becaus we do not need the  middlewar to provid a context select mechan. it can avoid the seriou consequ caus by a breakdown of the arbitr. also, it can guarante context provid" interest. 6. conclus and futur work how to provid the appropri context inform is a challeng problem in pervas comput. in thi paper, we have present a novel approach base on negoti with reward to attempt to solv such problem. distribut context provid negoti with each other to reach  agreement on the issu who can provid the appropri  context and how thei alloc the proce. the result of our experi have show that our approach can choos an appropri context provid, and also can guarante provid" interest by a rel fair proce alloc. in thi paper, we onli consid how to choos an  appropri context provid from two provid. in the futur work, thi negoti model will be extend, and more than two context provid can negoti with each other to decid who is the most appropri context provid. in the extend negoti model, how to design effici  negoti strategi will be a challeng problem. we assum that the context provid will fulfil it promis of reward in the next negoti process. in fact, the context provid might deceiv it oppon and provid illus promis. we should solv thi problem in the futur. we also should deal with interact which ar interrupt by fail  commun link in the futur work. 7. acknowledg the work is fund by 973 project of china(2002cb312002, 2006cb303000), nsfc(60403014) and nsfj(bk2006712). 8. refer [1] j. coutaz, j. l. crowlei, s. dobson, and d. garlan. context is kei. commun. acm, 48(3):49 - 53, march 2005.
