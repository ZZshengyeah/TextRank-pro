(typic, the strategi ar  allow to be mix, that is, probabl distribut over the origin (pure) strategi.) a (mix-strategi) nash  equilibrium is guarante to exist in finit game [18], but on problem is that there mai be multipl nash equilibria. thi lead to the equilibrium select problem of how an agent can know which strategi to plai if it doe not know which equilibrium is to be plai. when the set is model as an extens-form game, it is possibl to specifi that some player receiv some  inform about action taken by other earlier in the game befor decid on their action. nevertheless, in gener, the player do not know everyth that happen earlier in the game. becaus of thi, these game ar typic still analyz us an equilibrium concept, where on specifi a mix strategi for each player, and requir that each player"s strategi is a best respons to the other" strategi. (typic an addit constraint on the strategi is now impos to ensur that player do not plai in a wai that is irrat with respect to the inform that thei have  receiv so far. thi lead to refin of nash equilibrium such as subgam perfect and sequenti equilibrium.) howev, in mani real-world set, strategi ar not select in such a simultan manner. oftentim, on player (the leader) is abl to commit to a strategi befor anoth player (the follow). thi can be due to a  varieti of reason. for exampl, on of the player mai  arriv at the site at which the game is to be plai befor anoth agent (e.g., in econom set, on player mai enter a market earlier and commit to a wai of do  busi82 ness). such commit power ha a profound impact on how the game should be plai. for exampl, the leader mai be best off plai a strategi that is domin in the normal-form represent of the game. perhap the  earliest and best-known exampl of the effect of commit is that by von stackelberg [25], who show that, in cournot"s duopoli model [5], if on firm is abl to commit to a  product quantiti first, that firm will do much better than in the simultan-move (nash) solut. in gener, if  commit to mix strategi is possibl, then (under minor assumpt) it never hurt, and often help, to commit to a strategi [26]. be forc to commit to a pure strategi sometim help, and sometim hurt (for exampl,  commit to a pure strategi in rock-paper-scissor befor the other player"s decis will natur result in a loss). in thi paper, we will assum commit is alwai forc; if it is not, the player who ha the choic of whether to  commit can simpli compar the commit outcom to the non-commit (simultan-move) outcom. model of leadership ar especi import in set with multipl self-interest softwar agent. onc the code for an agent (or for a team of agent) is final and the agent is deploi, the agent is commit to plai the (possibl random) strategi that the code prescrib. thu, as long as on can credibl show that on cannot chang the code later, the code serv as a commit devic. thi hold true for recreat tournament among agent (e.g., poker tournament, robosocc), and for industri  applic such as sensor web. final, there is also an implicit leadership situat in the field of mechan design, in which on player (the design) get to choos the rule of the game that the remain  player then plai. mechan design is an extrem import topic to the ec commun: the paper publish on  mechan design in recent ec confer ar too numer to cite. inde, the mechan design mai benefit from commit to a choic that, if the (remain) agent"  action were fix, would be suboptim. for exampl, in a (first-price) auction, the seller mai wish to set a posit (artifici) reserv price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller valu the item at 0. in hindsight (after the bid have come in), thi (na¨ıveli)  appear suboptim: if a bid exceed the reserv price came in, the reserv price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accept a lower bid. of cours, the reason for set the reserv price is that it incentiv the bidder to bid higher, and becaus of thi, set artifici reserv price can actual increas expect revenu to the seller. a signific amount of research ha recent been  devot to the comput of solut accord to variou solut concept for set in which the agent choos their strategi simultan, such as domin [7, 11, 3] and (especi) nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4]. howev, the comput of the optim strategi to commit to in a leadership situat ha gone ignor.  theoret, leadership situat can simpli be thought of as an extens-form game in which on player choos a  strategi (for the origin game) first. the number of strategi in thi extens-form game, howev, can be exceedingli larg. for exampl, if the leader is abl to commit to a mix strategi in the origin game, then everi on of the (continuum of) mix strategi constitut a pure strategi in the extens-form represent of the leadership  situat. (we note that a commit to a distribut is not the same as a distribut over commit.) moreov, if the origin game is itself an extens-form game, the number of strategi in the extens-form represent of the leadership situat (which is a differ extens-form game) becom even larger. becaus of thi, it is usual not computation feasibl to simpli transform the  origin game into the extens-form represent of the  leadership situat; instead, we have to analyz the game in it origin represent. in thi paper, we studi how to comput the optim  strategi to commit to, both in normal-form game (section 2) and in bayesian game, which ar a special case of  extensiveform game (section 3). 2. normal-form game in thi section, we studi how to comput the optim strategi to commit to for game repres in normal form. 2.1 definit in a normal-form game, everi player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} ha a set of pure strategi (or action) si, and a util function ui : s1×s2×. . .×sn → r that map everi outcom (a vector consist of a pure strategi for everi player, also known as a profil of pure strategi) to a real number. to eas notat, in the case of two player, we will refer to player 1"s pure strategi set as s, and player 2"s pure strategi set as t. such game can be repres in (bi-)matrix form, in which the row correspond to player 1"s pure strategi, the column correspond to player 2"s pure strategi, and the entri of the matrix give the row and column player"s util (in that order) for the correspond outcom of the game. in the case of three player, we will us r, s, and t, for player 1, 2, and 3"s pure strategi, respect. a mix strategi for a player is a probabl distribut over that player"s pure strategi. in the case of two-player game, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follow. befor defin optim leadership strategi, consid the follow game which illustr the effect of the leader"s abil to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 in thi normal-form represent, the bottom strategi for the row player is strictli domin by the top strategi. nevertheless, if the row player ha the abil to commit to a pure strategi befor the column player choos hi  strategi, the row player should commit to the bottom strategi: do so will make the column player prefer to plai the right strategi, lead to a util of 3 for the row player. by contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategi, the column player would prefer to plai the left strategi, lead to a util of onli 2 for the row player. if the row player is abl to commit to a mix strategi, then she can get an even greater (expect) util: if the row player commit to place probabl p > 1/2 on the  bottom strategi, then the column player will still prefer to plai the right strategi, and the row player"s expect util will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3. if the row player plai each strategi with probabl exactli 1/2, the column player is 83 indiffer between the strategi. in such case, we will  assum that the column player will choos the strategi that maxim the row player"s util (in thi case, the right strategi). henc, the optim mix strategi to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2. there ar a few good  reason for thi assumpt. if we were to assum the opposit, then there would not exist an optim strategi for the row player in the exampl game: the row player would plai the bottom strategi with probabl p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the util for the row player. by contrast, if we assum that the follow alwai break ti in the leader"s favor, then an optim mix strategi for the leader alwai exist, and thi correspond to a  subgam perfect equilibrium of the extens-form  represent of the leadership situat. in ani case, thi is a  standard assumpt for such model (e.g. [20]), although some work ha investig what can happen in the other  subgam perfect equilibria [26]. (for gener two-player game, the leader"s subgam-perfect equilibrium payoff is uniqu.) also, the same assumpt is typic us in mechan design, in that it is assum that if an agent is indiffer  between reveal hi prefer truthfulli and reveal them fals, he will report them truthfulli. given thi  assumpt, we can safe refer to optim leadership strategi rather than have to us some equilibrium notion. henc, for the purpos of thi paper, an optim strategi to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategi s ∈ s that maxim maxt∈br(s) ul(s, t), where br(s) = arg maxt∈t uf (s, t). (ul and uf ar the leader and follow"s util function, respect.) we can have s = s for the case of commit to pure strategi, or s = ∆(s), the set of probabl distribut over s, for the case of  commit to mix strategi. (we note that replac t by ∆(t) make no differ in thi definit.) for game with more than two player, in which the player commit to their strategi in sequenc, we defin optim strategi to commit to recurs. after the leader commit to a strategi, the game to be plai by the remain agent is itself a (smaller) leadership game. thu, we defin an  optim strategi to commit to as a strategi that maxim the leader"s util, assum that the plai of the remain agent is itself optim under thi definit, and maxim the leader"s util among all optim wai to plai the  remain game. again, commit to mix strategi mai or mai not be a possibl for everi player (although for the last player it doe not matter if we allow for commit to mix strategi). 2.2 commit to pure strategi we first studi how to comput the optim pure strategi to commit to. thi is rel simpl, becaus the number of strategi to commit to is not veri larg. (in the follow, #outcom is the number of complet strategi profil.) theorem 1. under commit to pure strategi, the set of all optim strategi profil in a normal-form game can be found in o(#player · #outcom) time. proof. each pure strategi that the first player mai  commit to will induc a subgam for the remain player. we can solv each such subgam recurs to find all of it optim strategi profil; each of these will give the  origin leader some util. those that give the leader maxim util correspond exactli to the optim strategi profil of the origin game. we now present the algorithm formal. let su(g, s1) be the subgam that result after the first (remain) player in g plai s1 ∈ sg 1 . a game with 0 player is simpli an outcom of the game. the function append(s, o) append the strategi s to each of the vector of strategi in the set o. let e be the empti vector with no element. in a slight abus of notat, we will write ug 1 (c) when all strategi profil in the set c give player 1 the same util in the game g. (here, player 1 is the first remain player in the subgam g, not necessarili player 1 in the origin game.) we note that arg max is set-valu. then, the follow algorithm comput all optim strategi profil: algorithm solv(g) if g ha 0 player return {e} c ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ sg 1 { o ← solv(su(g, s1)) o ← arg maxo∈o ug 1 (s1, o) if c = ∅ or ug 1 (s1, o ) = ug 1 (c) c ← c∪append(s1, o ) if ug 1 (s1, o ) > ug 1 (c) c ←append(s1, o ) } return c everi outcom is (potenti) examin by everi player, which lead to the given runtim bound. as an exampl of how the algorithm work, consid the follow 3-player game, in which the first player choos the left or right matrix, the second player choos a row, and the third player choos a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 first we elimin the outcom that do not correspond to best respons for the third player (remov them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 next, we remov the entri in which the third player doe not break ti in favor of the second player, as well as entri that do not correspond to best respons for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 final, we remov the entri in which the second and third player do not break ti in favor of the first player, as well as entri that do not correspond to best respons for the first player. 2,1,1 84 henc, in optim plai, the first player choos the left matrix, the second player choos the middl row, and the third player choos the left column. (we note that thi outcom is pareto-domin by (right, middl, left).) for gener normal-form game, each player"s util for each of the outcom ha to be explicitli repres in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#player · #outcom). therefor, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 commit to mix strategi in the special case of two-player zero-sum game,  comput an optim mix strategi for the leader to commit to is equival to comput a minimax strategi, which  minim the maximum expect util that the oppon can obtain. minimax strategi constitut the onli natur  solut concept for two-player zero-sum game: von neumann"s minimax theorem [24] state that in two-player zero-sum game, it doe not matter (in term of the player" util) which player get to commit to a mix strategi first, and a profil of mix strategi is a nash equilibrium if and onli if both strategi ar minimax strategi. it is well-known that a minimax strategi can be found in polynomi time, us linear program [17]. our first result in thi  section gener thi result, show that an optim mix strategi for the leader to commit to can be effici  comput in gener-sum two-player game, again us linear program. theorem 2. in 2-player normal-form game, an optim mix strategi to commit to can be found in polynomi time us linear program. proof. for everi pure follow strategi t, we comput a mix strategi for the leader such that 1) plai t is a best respons for the follow, and 2) under thi constraint, the mix strategi maxim the leader"s util. such a mix strategi can be comput us the follow simpl linear program: maxim s∈s psul(s, t) subject to for all t ∈ t, s∈s psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈s psuf (s, t ) s∈s ps = 1 we note that thi program mai be infeas for some follow strategi t, for exampl, if t is a strictli  domin strategi. nevertheless, the program must be feasibl for at least some follow strategi; among these follow strategi, choos a strategi t∗ that maxim the linear program"s solut valu. then, if the leader choos as her mix strategi the optim set of the variabl ps for the linear program for t∗ , and the follow plai t∗ , thi constitut an optim strategi profil. in the follow result, we show that we cannot expect to solv the problem more effici than linear program, becaus we can reduc ani linear program with a probabl constraint on it variabl to a problem of comput the optim mix strategi to commit to in a 2-player  normalform game. theorem 3. ani linear program whose variabl xi (with xi ∈ r≥0 ) must satsifi i xi = 1 can be model as a  problem of comput the optim mix strategi to commit to in a 2-player normal-form game. proof. let the leader have a pure strategi i for everi variabl xi. let the column player have on pure  strategi j for everi constraint in the linear program (other than i xi = 1), and a singl addit pure strategi 0. let the util function be as follow. write the object of the linear program as maxim i cixi, for ani i, let ul(i, 0) = ci and uf (i, 0) = 0. write the jth constraint of the linear program (not includ i xi = 1) as i aijxi ≤ bj, for ani i, j > 0, let ul(i, j) = mini ci − 1 and uf (i, j) = aij − bj. for exampl, consid the follow linear program. maxim 2x1 + x2 subject to x1 + x2 = 1 5x1 + 2x2 ≤ 3 7x1 − 2x2 ≤ 2 the optim solut to thi program is x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3. our reduct transform thi program into the  follow leader-follow game (where the leader is the row player). 2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 inde, the optim strategi for the leader is to plai the top strategi with probabl 1/3 and the bottom strategi with probabl 2/3. we now show that the reduct work in gener. clearli, the leader want to incentiv the follow to plai 0, becaus the util that the leader get when the follow plai 0 is alwai greater than when the follow doe not plai 0. in order for the follow not to prefer plai j > 0 rather than 0, it must be the case that i pl(i)(aij − bj) ≤ 0, or equival i pl(i)aij ≤ bj. henc the leader will get a util of at least mini ci if and onli if there is a feasibl solut to the constraint. given that the pl(i) incentiv the follow to plai 0, the leader attempt to maxim i pl(i)ci. thu the leader must solv the origin linear program. as an altern proof of theorem 3, on mai observ that it is known that find a minimax strategi in a  zerosum game is as hard as the linear program problem [6], and as we point out at the begin of thi section,  comput a minimax strategi in a zero-sum game is a special case of the problem of comput an optim mix strategi to commit to. thi polynomi-time solvabl of the problem of  comput an optim mix strategi to commit to in two-player normal-form game contrast with the unknown complex of comput a nash equilibrium in such game [21], as well as with the np-hard of find a nash equilibrium with maximum util for a given player in such game [8, 2]. unfortun, thi result doe not gener to more than two player-here, the problem becom np-hard. to show thi, we reduc from the vertex-cover problem. definit 1. in vertex-cover, we ar given a graph g = (v, e) and an integ k. we ar ask whether there 85 exist a subset of the vertic s ⊆ v , with |s| = k, such that everi edg e ∈ e ha at least on of it endpoint in s. balanc-vertex-cover is the special case of vertex-cover in which k = |v |/2. vertex-cover is np-complet [9]. the follow lemma show that the hard remain if we requir k = |v |/2. (similar result have been shown for other np-complet problem.) lemma 1. balanc-vertex-cover is np-complet. proof. membership in np follow from the fact that the problem is a special case of vertex-cover, which is in np. to show np-hard, we reduc an arbitrari vertex-cover instanc to a  balanc-vertexcov instanc, as follow. if, for the vertex-cover instanc, k > |v |/2, then we simpli add isol vertic that ar disjoint from the rest of the graph, until k = |v |/2. if k < |v |/2, we add isol triangl (that is, the  complet graph on three vertic) to the graph, increas k by 2 everi time, until k = |v |/2. theorem 4. in 3-player normal-form game, find an optim mix strategi to commit to is np-hard. proof. we reduc an arbitrari  balanc-vertexcov instanc to the follow 3-player normal-form game. for everi vertex v, each of the three player ha a pure  strategi correspond to that vertex (rv, sv, tv, respect). in addit, for everi edg e, the third player ha a pure  strategi te; and final, the third player ha on addit pure strategi t0. the util ar as follow: • for all r ∈ r, s ∈ s, u1(r, s, t0) = u2(r, s, t0) = 1; • for all r ∈ r, s ∈ s, t ∈ t−{t0}, u1(r, s, t) = u2(r, s, t) = 0; • for all v ∈ v, s ∈ s, u3(rv, s, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ v, r ∈ r, u3(r, sv, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ v , for all r ∈ r − {rv}, s ∈ s − {sv}, u3(r, s, tv) = |v | |v |−2 ; • for all e ∈ e, s ∈ s, for both v ∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = 0; • for all e ∈ e, s ∈ s, for all v /∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = |v | |v |−2 . • for all r ∈ r, s ∈ s, u3(r, s, t0) = 1. we note that player 1 and 2 have the same util function. we claim that there is an optim strategi profil in which player 1 and 2 both obtain 1 (their maximum util) if and onli if there is a solut to the  balanc-vertexcov problem. (otherwis, these player will both obtain 0.) first, suppos there exist a solut to the  balancedvertex-cover problem. then, let player 1 plai everi rv such that v is in the cover with probabl 2 |v | , and let player 2 plai everi sv such that v is not in the cover with probabl 2 |v | . then, for player 3, the expect util of plai tv (for ani v) is (1 − 2 |v | ) |v | |v |−2 = 1, becaus there is a chanc of 2 |v | that rv or sv is plai.  addition, the expect util of plai te (for ani e) is at most (1 − 2 |v | ) |v | |v |−2 = 1, becaus there is a chanc of at least 2 |v | that some rv with v ∈ e is plai (becaus player 1 is random over the pure strategi correspond to the cover). it follow that plai t0 is a best respons for player 3, give player 1 and 2 a util of 1. now, suppos that player 1 and 2 obtain 1 in optim plai. then, it must be the case that player 3 plai t0. henc, for everi v ∈ v , there must be a probabl of at least 2 |v | that either rv or sv is plai, for otherwis player 3 would be better off plai tv. becaus player 1 and 2 have onli a total probabl of 2 to distribut, it must be the case that for each v, either rv or sv is plai with probabl 2 |v | , and the other is plai with probabl 0. (it is not possibl for both to have nonzero probabl, becaus then there would be some probabl that both ar plai  simultan (correl is not possibl), henc the total probabl of at least on be plai could not be high enough for all vertic.) thu, for exactli half the v ∈ v , player 1 place probabl 2 |v | on rv. moreov, for everi e ∈ e, there must be a probabl of at least 2 |v | that some rv with v ∈ e is plai, for otherwis player 3 would be  better off plai te. thu, the v ∈ v such that player 1 place probabl 2 |v | on rv constitut a balanc vertex cover. 3. bayesian game so far, we have restrict our attent to normal-form game. in a normal-form game, it is assum that everi agent know everi other agent"s prefer over the  outcom of the game. in gener, howev, agent mai have some privat inform about their prefer that is not known to the other agent. moreov, at the time of  commit to a strategi, the agent mai not even know their own (final) prefer over the outcom of the game yet, becaus these prefer mai be depend on a context that ha yet to materi. for exampl, when the code for a trade agent is written, it mai not yet be clear how that agent will valu resourc that it will negoti over later, becaus thi depend on inform that is not yet  avail at the time at which the code is written (such as order that will have been place to the agent befor the  negoti). in thi section, we will studi commit in bayesian game, which can model such uncertainti over prefer. 3.1 definit in a bayesian game, everi player i ha a set of action si, a set of type Θi with an associ probabl distribut πi : Θi → [0, 1], and, for each type θi, a util function uθi i : s1 × s2 × . . . × sn → r. a pure strategi in a bayesian game is a map from the player"s type to action, σi : Θi → si. (bayesian game can be rewritten in normal form by enumer everi pure strategi σi, but thi will caus an exponenti blowup in the size of the represent of the game and therefor cannot lead to effici algorithm.) the strategi that the leader should commit to depend on whether, at the time of commit, the leader know her own type. if the leader doe know her own type, the other type that the leader might have had becom  irrelev and the leader should simpli commit to the strategi that is optim for the type. howev, as argu abov, the leader doe not necessarili know her own type at the time of commit (e.g., the time at which the code is submit). in thi case, the leader must commit to a strategi that is 86 depend upon the leader"s eventu type. we will studi thi latter model, although we will pai specif attent to the case where the leader ha onli a singl type, which is effect the same as the former model. 3.2 commit to pure strategi it turn out that comput an optim pure strategi to commit to is hard in bayesian game, even with two player. theorem 5. find an optim pure strategi to commit to in 2-player bayesian game is np-hard, even when the follow ha onli a singl type. proof. we reduc an arbitrari vertex-cover  instanc to the follow bayesian game between the leader and the follow. the leader ha k type θ1, θ2, . . . , θk , each occur with probabl 1/k, and for everi vertex v ∈ v , the leader ha an action sv. the follow ha onli a singl type; for each edg e ∈ e, the follow ha an action te, and the follow ha a singl addit action t0. the util function for the leader is given by, for all θl ∈ Θl and all s ∈ s, u θl l (s, t0) = 1, and for all e ∈ e, u θl l (s, te) = 0. the follow"s util is given by: • for all v ∈ v , for all e ∈ e with v /∈ e, uf (sv, te) = 1; • for all v ∈ v , for all e ∈ e with v ∈ e, uf (sv, te) = −k; • for all v ∈ v , uf (sv, t0) = 0. we claim that the leader can get a util of 1 if and onli if there is a solut to the vertex-cover instanc. first, suppos that there is a solut to the  vertexcov instanc. then, the leader can commit to a pure strategi such that for each vertex v in the cover, the leader plai sv for some type. then, the follow"s util for  plai te (for ani e ∈ e) is at most k−1 k + 1 k (−k) = − 1 k , so that the follow will prefer to plai t0, which give the leader a util of 1, as requir. now, suppos that there is a pure strategi for the leader that will give the leader a util of 1. then, the follow must plai t0. in order for the follow not to prefer plai te (for ani e ∈ e) instead, for at least on v ∈ e the leader must plai sv for some type θl. henc, the set of vertic v that the leader plai for some type must constitut a vertex cover; and thi set can have size at most k, becaus the leader ha onli k type. so there is a solut to the  vertexcov instanc. howev, if the leader ha onli a singl type, then the problem becom easi again (#type is the number of type for the follow): theorem 6. in 2-player bayesian game in which the leader ha onli a singl type, an optim pure strategi to commit to can be found in o(#outcom · #type) time. proof. for everi leader action s, we can comput, for everi follow type θf ∈ Θf , which action t maxim the follow"s util; call thi set of action brθf (s). then, the util that the leader receiv for commit to action s can be comput as θf ∈Θf π(θf ) maxt∈brθf (s) ul(s, t), and the leader can choos the best action to commit to. 3.3 commit to mix strategi in two-player zero-sum imperfect inform game with perfect recal (no player ever forget someth that it onc knew), a minimax strategi can be construct in polynomi time [12, 13]. unfortun, thi result doe not extend to comput optim mix strategi to commit to in the gener-sum case-not even in bayesian game. we will  exhibit np-hard by reduc from the  independentset problem. definit 2. in independ-set, we ar given a graph g = (v, e) and an integ k. we ar ask whether there exist a subset of the vertic s ⊆ v , with |s| = k, such that no edg e ∈ e ha both of it endpoint in s. again, thi problem is np-complet [9]. theorem 7. find an optim mix strategi to  commit to in 2-player bayesian game is np-hard, even when the leader ha onli a singl type and the follow ha onli two action. proof. we reduc an arbitrari independ-set instanc to the follow bayesian game between the leader and the follow. the leader ha onli a singl type, and for everi vertex v ∈ v , the leader ha an action sv. the follow ha a type θv for everi v ∈ v , occur with probabl 1 (|e|+1)|v | , and a type θe for everi e ∈ e, occur with probabl 1 |e|+1 . the follow ha two action: t0 and t1. the leader"s util is given by, for all s ∈ s, ul(s, t0) = 1 and ul(s, t1) = 0. the follow"s util is given by: • for all v ∈ v , uθv f (sv, t1) = 0; • for all v ∈ v and s ∈ s − {sv}, uθv f (s, t1) = k k−1 ; • for all v ∈ v and s ∈ s, uθv f (s, t0) = 1; • for all e ∈ e, s ∈ s, uθe f (s, t0) = 1; • for all e ∈ e, for both v ∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 2k 3 ; • for all e ∈ e, for all v /∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 0. we claim that an optim strategi to commit to give the leader an expect util of at least |e| |e|+1 + k (|e|+1)|v | if and onli if there is a solut to the independ-set instanc. first, suppos that there is a solut to the independ-set instanc. then, the leader could  commit to the follow strategi: for everi vertex v in the  independ set, plai the correspond sv with probabl 1/k. if the follow ha type θe for some e ∈ e, the expect util for the follow of plai t1 is at most 1 k 2k 3 = 2/3, becaus there is at most on vertex v ∈ e such that sv is plai with nonzero probabl. henc, the follow will plai t0 and obtain a util of 1. if the follow ha type θv for some vertex v in the independ set, the expect util for the follow of plai t1 is k−1 k k k−1 = 1, becaus the leader plai sv with probabl 1/k. it follow that the follow (who break ti to maxim the leader"s util) will plai t0, which also give a util of 1 and give the leader a higher util. henc the leader"s expect util for thi strategi is at least |e| |e|+1 + k (|e|+1)|v | , as requir. 87 now, suppos that there is a strategi that give the leader an expect util of at least |e| |e|+1 + k (|e|+1)|v | . then, thi strategi must induc the follow to plai t0 whenev it ha a type of the form θe (becaus otherwis, the util could be at most |e|−1 |e|+1 + |v | (|e|+1)|v | = |e| |e|+1 < |e| |e|+1 + k (|e|+1)|v | ). thu, it cannot be the case that for some edg e = (v1, v2) ∈ e, the probabl that the leader plai on of sv1 and sv2 is at least 2/k, becaus then the expect util for the follow of plai t1 when it ha type θe would be at least 2 k 2k 3 = 4/3 > 1. moreov, the strategi must induc the follow to plai t0 for at least k type of the form θv. induc the follow to plai t0 when it ha type θv can be done onli by plai sv with probabl at least 1/k, which will give the follow a util of at most k−1 k k k−1 = 1 for plai t1. but then, the set of vertic v such that sv is plai with probabl at least 1/k must constitut an independ set of size k (becaus if there were an edg e between two such vertic, it would induc the follow to plai t1 for type θe by the abov). by contrast, if the follow ha onli a singl type, then we can gener the linear program approach for  normalform game: theorem 8. in 2-player bayesian game in which the follow ha onli a singl type, an optim mix strategi to commit to can be found in polynomi time us linear program. proof. we gener the approach in theorem 2 as  follow. for everi pure follow strategi t, we comput a mix strategi for the leader for everi on of the leader"s type such that 1) plai t is a best respons for the follow, and 2) under thi constraint, the mix strategi maxim the leader"s ex ant expect util. to do so, we gener the linear program as follow: maxim θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈s pθl s uθl l (s, t) subject to for all t ∈ t, θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈s p θl s uf (s, t) ≥ θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈s p θl s uf (s, t ) for all θl ∈ Θl, s∈s p θl s = 1 as in theorem 2, the solut for the linear program that maxim the solut valu is an optim strategi to  commit to. thi show an interest contrast between commit to pure strategi and commit to mix strategi in bayesian game: for pure strategi, the problem becom easi if the leader ha onli a singl type (but not if the  follow ha onli a singl type), wherea for mix strategi, the problem becom easi if the follow ha onli a singl type (but not if the leader ha onli a singl type). 4. conclus and futur research in multiag system, strateg set ar often  analyz under the assumpt that the player choos their strategi simultan. thi requir some equilibrium notion (nash equilibrium and it refin), and often lead to the equilibrium select problem: it is unclear to each individu player accord to which equilibrium she should plai. howev, thi model is not alwai realist. in mani set, on player is abl to commit to a strategi befor the other player make a decis. for exampl, on agent mai arriv at the (real or virtual) site of the game befor the other, or, in the specif case of softwar agent, the code for on agent mai be complet and commit  befor that of anoth agent. such model ar synonym refer to as leadership, commit, or stackelberg  model, and optim plai in such model is often significantli differ from optim plai in the model where strategi ar select simultan. specif, if commit to mix strategi is possibl, then (optim) commit never hurt the leader, and often help. the recent surg in interest in comput game-theoret solut ha so far ignor leadership model (with the  except of the interest in mechan design, where the  design is implicitli in a leadership posit). in thi paper, we studi how to comput optim strategi to commit to under both commit to pure strategi and  commit to mix strategi, in both normal-form and bayesian game. for normal-form game, we show that the optim pure strategi to commit to can be found effici for ani number of player. an optim mix strategi to commit to in a normal-form game can be found effici for two player us linear program (and no more effici than that, in the sens that ani linear program with a  probabl constraint can be encod as such a problem). (thi is a gener of the polynomi-time comput of minimax strategi in normal-form game.) the problem becom np-hard for three (or more) player. in bayesian game, the problem of find an optim pure strategi to commit to is np-hard even in two-player game in which the follow ha onli a singl type, although two-player game in which the leader ha onli a singl type can be solv effici. the problem of find an optim mix  strategi to commit to in a bayesian game is np-hard even in two-player game in which the leader ha onli a singl type, although two-player game in which the follow ha onli a singl type can be solv effici us a gener of the linear progam approach for normal-form game. the follow two tabl summar these result. 2 player ≥ 3 player normal-form o(#outcom) o(#outcom· #player) bayesian, o(#outcom· np-hard 1-type leader #type) bayesian, np-hard np-hard 1-type follow bayesian (gener) np-hard np-hard result for commit to pure strategi. (with more than 2 player, the follow is the last player to commit, the leader is the first.) 88 2 player ≥ 3 player normal-form on lp-solv per np-hard follow action bayesian, np-hard np-hard 1-type leader bayesian, on lp-solv per np-hard 1-type follow follow action bayesian (gener) np-hard np-hard result for commit to mix strategi. (with more than 2 player, the follow is the last player to commit, the leader is the first.) futur research can take a number of direct. first, we can empir evalu the techniqu present here on test suit such as gamut [19]. we can also studi the  comput of optim strategi to commit to in other1  concis represent of normal-form game-for exampl, in graphic game [10] or local-effect/action graph game [14, 1]. for the case where comput an optim strategi to commit to is np-hard, we can also studi the comput of approxim optim strategi to commit to. while the correct definit of an approxim optim strategi is in thi set mai appear simpl at first-it should be a  strategi that, if the follow player plai optim, perform almost as well as the optim strategi in expect-thi definit becom problemat when we consid that the other player mai also be plai onli approxim  optim. on mai also studi model in which multipl (but not all) player commit at the same time. anoth interest direct to pursu is to see if  comput optim mix strategi to commit to can help us in, or otherwis shed light on, comput nash equilibria. often, optim mix strategi to commit to ar also nash equilibrium strategi (for exampl, in two-player zero-sum game thi is alwai true), although thi is not alwai the case (for exampl, as we alreadi point out, sometim the optim strategi to commit to is a strictli domin  strategi, which can never be a nash equilibrium strategi). 5. refer [1] n. a. r. bhat and k. leyton-brown. comput nash equilibria of action-graph game. in proceed of the 20th annual confer on uncertainti in artifici intellig (uai), banff, canada, 2004.
