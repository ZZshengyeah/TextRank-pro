i.2.11 [artifici intellig]: distribut artifici  intellig-intellig agent, multiag system; g.3 [mathemat of  comput]: probabl and statist-distribut function gener term algorithm, experiment 1. introduct for mani real-world scenario, autonom agent need to  oper in dynam, uncertain environ in which thei have onli incomplet inform about the result of their action and  characterist of other agent or peopl with whom thei need to  cooper or collabor. in such environ, agent can benefit from share inform thei gather, pool their individu  experi to improv their estim of unknown paramet  requir for reason about action under uncertainti. thi paper address the problem of learn the distribut of the valu of a probabilist paramet that repres a  characterist of a person who is interact with a comput agent. the  characterist to be learn is (or is clearli relat to) an import  factor in the agent"s decis make.1 the basic set we consid is on in which an agent accumul observ about a  specif user characterist and us them to produc a time estim of some measur that depend on that characterist"s distribut. the mechan we develop ar design to be us in a rang of applic domain, such as disast rescu, that ar character by environ in which condit mai be rapidli chang,  action (whether of autonom agent or of peopl) and the overal oper occur at a fast pace, and decis must be made within tightli constrain time frame. typic, agent must make  decis in real time, concurr with task execut, and in the midst of great uncertainti. in the remaind of thi paper, we us the term fast-pace to refer to such environ. in fast-pace  environ, inform gather mai be limit, and it is not possibl to learn offlin or to wait until larg amount of data ar collect befor make decis. fast-pace environ impos three constraint on ani  mechan for learn a distribut function (includ the larg rang of bayesian updat techniqu [23]): (a) the no structur constraint: no a priori inform about the structur of the estim  paramet"s distribut nor ani initi data from which such structur can be infer is avail; (b) the limit us constraint: agent typic need to produc onli a small number of estim in total for thi paramet; (c) the earli us constraint: high  accuraci is a critic requir even in the initi stage of learn. thu, the goal of the estim method present in thi paper is to minim the averag error over time, rather than to determin an accur valu at the end of a long period of interact. that is, the agent is expect to work with the user for a limit time, and it attempt to minim the overal error in it estim. in such environ, an agent"s individu acquir data (it own observ) ar too spars for it to obtain good estim in the requisit time frame. given the no-structur-constraint of the  environ, approach that depend on structur distribut mai result in a significantli high estim bia. we consid thi problem in the context of a multi-agent  distribut system in which comput agent support peopl who ar carri out complex task in a dynam environ. the fact that agent ar part of a multi-agent set, in which other agent mai 1 learn the distribut rather than just determin some valu in the distribut is import whenev the overal shape of the distribut and not just such individu featur as mean ar import. also be gather data to estim a similar characterist of their user, offer the possibl for an agent to augment it own  observ with those of other agent, thu improv the accuraci of it learn process. furthermor, in the environ we consid, agent ar usual accumul data at a rel similar rate. nonetheless, the extent to which the observ of other agent will be us to a given agent depend on the extent to which their user" characterist" distribut ar correl with that of thi agent"s user. there is no guarante that the distribut for two differ agent is highli, posit correl, let alon that thei ar the same. therefor, to us a data-share approach, a  learn mechan must be capabl of effect identifi the level of correl between the data collect by differ agent and to weigh share data depend on the level of correl. the design of a coordin autonomi (ca) modul within a coordin-manag system (as part of the darpa coordin project [18]), in which agent support a distribut schedul task, provid the initi motiv and a conceptu set for thi work. howev, the mechan themselv ar gener and can be appli not onli to other fast-pace domain, but also in other multi-agent set in which agent ar collect data that  overlap to some extent, at approxim similar rate, and in which the environ impos the no-structur, limit- and earli-us constraint defin abov (e.g., explor of remot planet). in particular, our techniqu would be us in ani set in which a group of agent undertak a task in a new environ, with each agent obtain observ at a similar rate of individu  paramet thei need for their decis-make. in thi paper, we present a mechan that wa us for  learn kei user characterist in fast-pace environ. the  mechan provid rel accur estim within short time frame by augment an individu agent"s direct observ with observ obtain by other agent with which it is  coordin. in particular, we focu on the relat problem of estim the cost of interrupt a person and estim the probabl that that person will have the inform requir by the system. our adapt approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as select-share, allow our ca to improv the accuraci of it distribut-base estim in comparison to reli onli on the interact with a specif user (subsequ, self-learn) or pool all data uncondition (averag all), in particular when the number of avail observ is rel small. the mechan wa successfulli test us a system that  simul a coordin environ. the next section of the paper describ the problem of estim user-relat paramet in  fastpac domain. section 3 provid an overview of the method we develop. the implement, empir set, and result ar given in section 4 and 5. a comparison with relat method is given in section 6 and conclus in section 7. 2. paramet estim in  fastpac domain the ca modul and algorithm we describ in thi paper were develop and test in the coordin domain [21]. in thi  domain, autonom agent, call coordin, ar intend to help maxim an overal team object by handl chang in the task schedul as condit of oper chang. each agent oper on behalf of it owner (e.g., the team leader of a  firstrespons team or a unit command) whose schedul it manag. thu, the actual task be schedul ar execut either by  owner or by unit thei overse, and the agent"s respons is limit to maintain the schedul of these task and coordin with the agent of other human team member (i.e., other owner). in thi domain, schedul inform and constraint ar distribut. each agent receiv a differ view of the task and structur that constitut the full multi-agent problem-typic onli a partial, local on. schedul revis that affect more than on agent must be coordin, so agent thu must share certain kind of  inform. (in a team context thei mai be design to share other type as well.) howev, the fast-pace natur of the domain constrain the amount of inform thei can share, preclud a central solut; schedul problem must be solv distribut. the agent-owner relationship is a collabor on, with the agent need to interact with it owner to obtain task and  environ inform relev to schedul. the ca modul is  respons for decid intellig when and how to interact with the owner for improv the agent"s schedul. as a result, the ca must estim the expect benefit of ani such interact and the cost associ with it [19]. in gener, the net benefit of a potenti interact is pv âˆ’ c, where v is the valu of the inform the user mai have, p is the probabl that the user ha thi  inform, and c is the cost associ with an interact. the valu of p, v , and c ar time-vari, and the ca estim their valu at the intend time of initi the interact with it owner. thi paper focus on the twin problem of estim the paramet p and c, both of which ar user-centric in the sens of be  determin by characterist of the owner and the environ in which the owner is oper); it presum a mechan for determin v [18]. 2.1 estim interrupt cost the cost of interrupt owner deriv from the potenti  degrad in perform of task thei ar do caus by the  disrupt [1; 9, inter alia]. research on interact manag ha  deploi sensor-base statist model of human interrupt to infer the degre of distract like to be caus by an interrupt. thi work aim to reduc interrupt cost by delai  interrupt to time that ar conveni. it typic us bayesian model to learn a user"s current or like futur focu of attent from an ongo stream of action. by us sensor to provid continu incom indic of the user"s attent state, these model attempt to provid a mean for comput probabl distribut over a user"s attent and intent [9]. work which examin such interrupt-cost factor as user frustrat and  distract [10] includ work on the cost of repeatedli bother the user which take into account the fact that recent interrupt and  difficult question should carri more weight than interrupt in the distant past or straightforward question [5]. although thi prior work us interrupt estim to  balanc the interact"s estim import against the degre of distract like to be caus, it differ from the fast-pace  environ problem we address in three wai that fundament chang the natur of the problem and henc alter the possibl  solut. first, it consid set in which the comput system ha inform that mai be relev to it user rather than the user (owner) have inform need by the system, which is the complement of the inform exchang situat we consid. second, the interrupt-estim model ar task-base. lastli, it reli on continu monitor of a user"s activ. in fast-pace environ, there usual is no singl task  structur, and some of the activ themselv mai have littl intern structur. as a result, it is difficult to determin the actual  attent state of agent-owner [15]. in such set, owner must make complex decis that typic involv a number of other member of their unit, while remain reactiv to event that  diverg from expect [24]. for instanc, dure disast  rescu, a first-respons unit mai begin rescu survivor trap in a burn hous, when a wall collaps suddenli, forc the unit to the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 203 retract and re-plan their action. prior work ha track user" focu of attent us a rang of devic, includ those abl to monitor gestur [8] and track  eyegaz to identifi focu of visual attent [13, 20], thu enabl  estim of cognit load and physic indic of perform degrad. the mechan describ in thi paper also presum the exist of such sensor. howev, in contrast to prior work, which reli on these devic oper continu, our  mechan presum that fast-pace environ onli allow for the activ of sensor for short period of time on an ad-hoc basi, becaus agent" resourc ar sever limit. method that depend on predict what a person will do next base onli on what the user is current do (e.g., mdp) ar not appropri for model focu of attent in fast-pace domain, becaus an agent cannot reli on a person"s attent state be well structur and monitor can onli be done on a sporad, non-continu basi. thu, at ani given time, the cost of  interact with the user is essenti probabilist, as reflect over a singl random monitor event, and can be assign a probabl distribut function. consequ, in fast-pace environ, an agent need a sampl strategi by which the ca sampl it owner"s interrupt level (with some cost) and decid whether to initi an interact at thi specif time or to delai until a lower cost is observ in futur sampl. the method we describ in the remaind of thi subsect appli concept from econom search theori [16] to thi problem. the ca"s cost estim us a mechan that integr the distribut of an owner"s  interrupt level (as estim by the ca) into an econom search strategi, in a wai that the overal combin cost of sensor cost and interact cost is minim. in it most basic form, the econom search problem aim to identifi an opportun that will minim expect cost or  maxim expect util. the search process itself is associ with a cost, and opportun (in our case, interrupt opportun) ar associ with a stationari distribut function. we us a  sequenti search strategi [16] in which on observ is drawn at a time, over multipl search stage. the domin strategi in thi model is a reserv-valu base strategi which determin a lower bound, and keep draw sampl as long as no opportun abov the bound wa drawn. in particular, we consid the situat in which an agent"s owner ha an interrupt cost describ by a probabl distribut  function (pdf) f(x) and a cumul distribut function (cdf) f(x). the agent can activ sens devic to get an estim of the interrupt cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of  oper the sens devic for a singl time unit. the ca modul set a reserv valu and as long as the sensor-base  observ x is greater than thi reserv valu, the ca will wait and re-sampl the user for a new estim. the expect cost, v (xrv), us such a strategi with  reserv valu xrv is describ by equat 1, v (xrv) = c + r xrv y=0 yf(y) f(xrv) , (1) which decompos into two part. the first part, c divid by f(xrv), repres the expect sampl cost. the second, the integr divid by f(xrv), repres the expect cost of  interrupt, becaus the expect number of search cycl is  (random) geometr and the probabl of success is f(xrv). take the deriv of the left-hand-side of equat 1 and equat it to zero, yield the characterist of the optim reserv valu, name xâˆ— rv must satisfi, v (xâˆ— rv) = xâˆ— rv. (2) substitut (2) in equat 1 yield equat 3 (after integr by part) from which the optim reserv valu, xâˆ— rv, and  consequ (from equat 2) v (xâˆ— rv) can be comput. c = z xâˆ— rv y=0 f(y) (3) thi method, which depend on extract the optim sequenc of sensor-base user sampl, reli heavili on the structur of the distribut function, f(x). howev, we need onli a portion of the distribut function, name from the origin to the reserv valu. (see equat 1 and figur 1.) thu, when we consid share data, it is not necessari to reli on complet similar in the distribut function of differ user. for some paramet, includ the user"s interrupt level, it is enough to reli on similar in the relev portion of the distribut function. the implement describ in section 4-5 reli on thi fact. figur 1: the distribut structur affect the expect cost"s calcul 2.2 estim the probabl of have  inform on wai an agent can estim the probabl a user will have inform it need (e.g., will know at a specif interrupt time, with some level of reliabl, the actual outcom of a task current be execut) is to reli on prior interact with thi user,  calcul the ratio between the number of time the user had the inform and the total number of interact. altern, the agent can attempt to infer thi probabl from measur  characterist of the user"s behavior, which it can assess without  requir an interrupt. thi indirect approach, which doe not requir interrupt the user, is especi us in fast-pace domain. the ca modul we design us such an indirect method:  ownerenviron interact ar us as a proxi for measur whether the owner ha certain inform. for instanc, in  coordinatorslik scenario, owner mai obtain a varieti of inform through occasion coordin meet of all owner, direct  commun with other individu owner particip in the execut of a joint task (through which thei mai learn inform about the exist or statu of other action thei ar execut), open  commun thei overhear (e.g. if command leav their radio open, thei can listen to messag associ with other team in their area), and other formal or inform commun channel [24]. thu, owner" level of commun with other, which can be obtain without interrupt them, provid some indic of the frequenc with which thei obtain new inform. given occasion updat about it owner"s level of commun, the ca can estim the probabl that a random interact with the owner will yield the inform it need. denot the  probabl distribut function of the amount of commun the user gener maintain with it environ by g(x), and us the transform function z(x), map from a level of  commun, x, to a probabl of have the inform, the expect probabl of get the inform that is need from the owner when interrupt at a given time can be calcul from p = z âˆž 0 z(x)g(x)dy. (4) 204 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) the more observ an agent can accumul about the  distribut of the frequenc of an owner"s interact with the  environ at a given time, the better it can estim the probabl the owner ha the inform need by the system. 3. the select-share mechan thi section present the select-share mechan by which the ca learn the distribut function of a probabilist paramet by take advantag of data collect by other ca in it  environ. we first explain the need for increas the number of  observ us as the basi of estim and then present a method for determin how much data to adopt from other agent. the most straightforward method for the ca to learn the  distribut function associ with the differ paramet  character an owner is by build a histogram base on the  observ it ha accumul up to the estim point. base on thi histogram, the ca can estim the paramet either by  take into account the entir rang of valu (e.g., to estim the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expect cost when us a reserv-valu-base strategi). the accuraci of the estim will vari wide if it is base on onli a small number of  observ. for exampl, figur 2 illustr the reserv-valu-base cost calcul accord to observ receiv from an owner with a uniform interrupt cost distribut u(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumul observ us for gener the distribut histogram. (in thi simul, devic activ cost wa taken to be c = 0.5). figur 2: the converg of a singl ca to it optim strategi these deviat from the actual (true) valu (which is 10 in thi case, accord to equat 3) is becaus the sampl us in each stage cannot accur captur the actual structur of the  distribut function. eventu thi method yield a veri accur  estim for the expect interrupt cost. howev, in the  initi stage of the process, it estim deviat significantli from the true valu. thi error could serious degrad the ca"s  decis make process: underestim the cost mai result in  initi costli, non-benefici interact, and overestim the cost might result in miss opportun for valuabl interact. ani improv that can be achiev in predict the cost valu, especi in the initi stage of learn, can make a signific differ in perform, especi becaus the agent is sever limit in the number of time it can interact with it owner in  fastpac domain. on wai to decreas the deviat from the actual valu is by augment the data the ca acquir by observ it owner with observ made by other owner" agent. such an approach  depend on identifi other owner with distribut function for the characterist of interest similar to the ca"s owner. thi  dataaugment idea is simpl: differ owner mai exhibit  similar basic behavior or pattern in similar fast-pace task scenario. sinc thei ar all coordin on a common overal task and ar oper in the same environ, it is reason to assum some level of similar in the distribut function of their model  paramet. peopl vari in their behavior, so, obvious, there mai be differ type of owner: some will emphas commun with their team, and some will spend more time on map-base plan; some will dislik be disturb while try to evalu their team"s progress, while other mai be more open to  interrupt. consequ, an owner"s ca is like to be abl to find some ca that ar work with owner who ar similar to it owner. when adopt data collect by other agent, the two main question ar which agent the ca should reli on and to what  extent it should reli on each of them. the select-share  mechan reli on a statist measur of similar that allow the ca of ani specif user to identifi the similar between it owner and other owner dynam. base on thi similar level, the ca decid if and to what degre to import other ca" data in order to augment it direct observ, and thu to enabl better model of it owner"s characterist. it is notabl that the cost of transfer observ between differ ca modul of differ agent is rel small. thi inform can be transfer as part of regular negoti  commun between agent. the volum of such commun is neglig: it involv just the transmiss of new observ" valu. in our learn mechan, the ca constantli updat it  estim of the level of similar between it owner and the owner repres by other ca in the environ. each new  observ obtain either by that ca or ani of the other ca updat thi estim. the similar level is determin us the wilcoxon rank-sum test (subsect 3.1). whenev it is necessari to produc a paramet estim, the ca decid on the number of addit observ it intend to reli on for extract it estim. the number of addit  observ to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observ it current ha from former interact with it owner and the level of confid the ca ha in the  similar between it owner and other owner. in most case, the  number of observ the ca will want to take from anoth agent is smaller than the overal number of observ the other agent ha; thu, it randomli sampl (without repetit) the requir  number of observ from thi other agent"s databas. the addit observ the ca take from other agent ar us onli to model it owner"s characterist. futur similar level determin is not affect by thi inform augment procedur. 3.1 the wilcoxon test we us a nonparametr method (i.e., on that make no  assumpt about the parametr form of the distribut each set is drawn from), becaus user characterist in fast-pace domain do not have the structur need for parametr approach. two  addit advantag of a non-parametr approach ar their us for deal with unexpect, outli observ (possibl  problemat for a parametr approach), and the fact that non-parametr approach ar computation veri simpl and thu ideal for  set in which comput resourc ar scarc. the wilcoxon rank-sum test we us is a nonparametr  altern to the two-sampl t-test [22, 14]2 . while the t-test  compar mean, the wilcoxon test can be us to test the null  hypothesi that two popul x and y have the same continu distribut. we assum that we have independ random  sampl {x1, x2, ..., xm} and {y1, y2, ..., yn}, of size m and n  respect, from each popul. we then merg the data and rank each measur from lowest to highest. all sequenc of ti ar assign an averag rank. from the sum of the rank of the smaller 2 chi-squar good-of-fit test is for a singl sampl and thu not  suitabl. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 205 sampl, we calcul the test statist and extract the level of  confid for reject the null hypothesi. thi level of confid becom the measur for the level of similar between the two owner. the wilcoxon test doe not requir that the data origin from a normal distribut popul or that the distribut is character by a finit set of paramet. 3.2 determin requir inform correctli identifi the right number of addit observ to gather is a kei determin of success of the select-share mechan. obvious, if the ca can identifi anoth owner who ha ident characterist to the owner it repres, then it should us all of the observ collect by that owner"s agent.  howev, case of ident match ar like to be veri uncommon. furthermor, even to establish that anoth user is ident to it own, the ca would need substanti sampl size to have a  rel high level of confid. thu, usual the ca need to decid how much to reli on anoth agent"s data while estim variou level of similar with a chang level of confid. at the begin of it process, the select-share mechan ha almost no data to reli on, and thu no similar measur can be us. in thi case, the ca modul reli heavili on other agent, in the expect that all owner have some basic level of  similar in their distribut (see section 2). as the number of it direct observ increas, the ca modul refin the number of addit observ requir. again, there ar two conflict effect. on on hand, the more data the ca ha, the better it can determin it level of confid in the similar rate it ha for other owner. on the other hand, assum there is some differ among owner (even if not notic yet), as the number of it direct observ increas, the owner"s own data should gain weight in it analysi. therefor, when cai decid how mani addit observ, oi j should be adopt from caj"s databas, it  calcul oi j as follow: oi j = n âˆ— (1 âˆ’ Î±i,j) âˆš n + 2 + ln(n) n (5) where n is the number of observ cai alreadi ha (which is similar in magnitud to the number of observ caj ha) and Î±i,j is the confid of reject the wilcoxon null hypothesi. the function in equat 5 ensur that the number of addit observ to be taken from anoth ca modul increas as the confid in the similar with the sourc for these addit  observ increas. at the same time, it ensur that the level of depend on extern observ decreas as the number of  direct observ increas. when calcul the paramet Î±i,j, we alwai perform the test over the interv relev to the  origin ca"s distribut function. for exampl, when estim the cost of interrupt the user, we appli the wilcoxon test onli for observ in the interv that start from zero and end slightli to the right of the formerli estim rv (see figur 1). 4. empir set we test the select-share mechan in a system that  simul a distribut, coordin-like ma. thi testb  environ includ a variabl number of agent, each correspond to a singl ca modul. each agent is assign an extern sourc  (simul an owner) which it period sampl to obtain a valu from the distribut be estim. the simul system  enabl us to avoid unnecessari inter-agent schedul and  commun overhead (which ar an inher part of the coordin environ) and thu to better isol the perform and  effect of the estim and decis-make mechan. the distribut function us in the experi (i.e., the  distribut function assign to each user in the simul  environ) ar multi-rectangular shape. thi type of function is ideal for repres empir distribut function. it is compos of k rectangl, where each rectangl i is defin over the interv (xiâˆ’1, xi), and repres a probabl pi, ( pk i=1 pi =1). for ani valu x in rectangl i, we can formul f(x) and f(x) as: f(x) = pi xi âˆ’ xiâˆ’1 f(x) = iâˆ’1x j=1 pj + (x âˆ’ xiâˆ’1)pi xi âˆ’ xiâˆ’1 (6) for exampl, the multi-rectangular function in figur 3 depict a possibl interrupt cost distribut for a specif user. each  rectangl is associ with on of the user"s typic activ,  character by a set of typic interrupt cost.

differ combin of  distribut function can result in an inabl to exactli identifi the similar user for some of the specif type. for exampl, for type i agent, the select-share mechan actual perform wors than self-learn in the short term (in the long run the two  method" perform converg). nevertheless, for the other type in our exampl, the select-share mechan is the most effici on, and outperform the other two method overal. third, it is notabl that for agent that have a uniqu type (e.g., agent iii), the select-share mechan quickli converg  toward reli on self-collect data. thi behavior guarante that even in scenario in which user ar complet differ, the method exhibit a grace initi degrad but manag, within a few time step, to adopt the proper behavior of count exclus on self-gener data. last, despit the differ in their overal distribut function, agent of type iv and v exhibit similar perform becaus the relev portion of their distribut function (i.e., the effect part that affect the rv calcul as explain in figur 1) is ident. thu, the select-share mechan enabl the agent of type v, despit it uniqu distribut function, to adopt  relev inform collect by agent of type iv which improv it estim of the expect interrupt cost. 5.2 gener evalu to evalu select-share, we ran a seri of simul in which the environ wa randomli gener. these  experi focus on the ca" estim of the probabl that the user would have the requir inform if interrupt. thei us a multi-rectangular probabl distribut function to repres the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 207 the amount of commun the user is engag in with it  environ. we model the growth of the probabl the user ha the requir inform as a function of the amount of  commun us the logist function,5 g(x) = 1 + e âˆ’x 12 1 + 60e âˆ’x 12 .

for each type, a random 3-rectangl distribut function wa gener. each simul ran 40 time step. at each time step each on of the agent accumul on addit observ. each ca  calcul an estim of the probabl it

differ between thi latter method and the two other method. the averag differ between select-share and self-learn decreas as more data is collect. final, we measur the effect of the number of type in the environ. for thi purpos, we us the same self-gener method, but control the number of type gener for each run. the number of type is a good indic for the level of  heterogen in the environ. for each number of type, we ran 10000 simul. figur 6 depict the perform of the  differ method (for a 40-observ collect period for each agent). sinc all simul run us for gener figur 6 ar base on the same seed, the perform of the self-learn mechan is constant regardless of the number of type in the environ. as expect, the averag-all mechan perform best when all agent ar of the same type; howev it perform deterior as the number of type increas. similarli, the select-share  mechan exhibit good result when all agent ar of the same type, and as the number of type increas, it perform deterior. howev, the perform decreas is significantli more modest in comparison to the on experienc in the averag-all mechan. 5 the specif coeffici us guarante an s-like curv of growth, along the interv (0,

select-share mechan describ in thi paper. collabor filter, which make predict (filter) about the interest of a user [7], oper similarli to select-share. howev, collabor filter system exhibit poor perform when there is not suffici inform about the user and when there is not suffici inform about a new user whose tast the system attempt to predict [7]. select-share reli on the abil to find similar between specif part of the probabl distribut function associ with a characterist of differ user. thi capabl is close relat to cluster and classif, an area wide studi in machin learn. given space consider, our review of thi area is  restrict to some repres approach for cluster. in spite of the rich of avail cluster algorithm (such as the famou k-mean cluster algorithm [11], hierarch method, bayesian classifi [6], and maximum entropi), variou characterist of fast-pace domain do not align well with the featur of  attributesbas cluster mechan, suggest these mechan would not perform well in such domain. of particular import is that the ca need to find similar between function, defin over a continu interv, with no distinct pre-defin attribut. an  addit difficulti is defin the distanc measur. mani cluster techniqu have been us in data mine [2], with particular focu on increment updat of the cluster, due to the veri larg size of the databas [3]. howev the  applic of these to fast-pace domain is quit limit becaus thei reli on a larg set of exist data. similarli, cluster algorithm  design for the task of class identif in spatial databas (e.g., reli on a densiti-base notion [4]) ar not us for our case, becaus our data ha no spatial attribut. the most relev method for our purpos is the kullback-leibler rel entropi index that is us in probabl theori and  inform theori [12]. thi measur, which can also be appli on continu random variabl, reli on a natur distanc measur from a true probabl distribut (either observ-base or calcul) to an arbitrari probabl distribut. howev, the method will perform poorli in scenario in which the function  altern between differ level while keep the gener  structur and moment. for exampl, consid the two function f(x) = ( x mod2)/100 and g(x) = ( x mod2)/100 defin over the  interv (0, 200). while these two function ar associ with  almost ident reserv valu (for ani sampl cost) and mean, the kullback-leibler method will assign a poor correl between 208 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) them, while our wilcoxon-base approach will give them the  highest rank in term of similar. while the wilcoxon test is a wide us statist procedur [22, 14], it is usual us for compar two set of singl-variat data. to our knowledg, no attempt ha been made yet to  extend it properti as an infrastructur for determin with whom and to what extent inform should be share, as present in thi paper. typic us of thi non-parametr tool includ  detect of rare event in time seri (e.g., a hard drive failur  predict [17]) and bioinformat applic (e.g., find inform gene from microarrai data). in these applic, it is us  primarili as an identif tool and rank criterion. 7. discuss and conclus the select-share mechan present in thi paper doe not make ani assumpt about the format of the data us or about the structur of the distribut function of the paramet to be estim. it is computation lightweight and veri simpl to execut. select-share allow an agent to benefit from other agent" observ in scenario in which data sourc of the same type ar avail. it also guarante, as a fallback, perform equival to that of a self-learner when the inform sourc is uniqu. furthermor, select-share doe not requir ani prior knowledg about the type of inform sourc avail in the environ or of the number of agent associ with each type. the result of our simul demonstr the select-share mechan"s effect in improv the estim produc for probabilist paramet base on a limit set of observ. furthermor, most of the improv is achiev in initi  interact, which is of great import for agent oper in fast-pace environ. although we test the select-share mechan in the context of the coordin project, it is  applic in ani ma environ have the characterist of a fast-pace environ (e.g., rescu environ). evid for it gener effect is given in the gener evalu section, where environ were continu randomli gener. the wilcoxon statist us as describ in thi paper to provid a classifi for similar between user provid high flexibl with low comput cost and is applic for ani  characterist be learn. it us provid a good measur of similar which an agent can us to decid how much extern inform to adopt for it assess. 8. acknowledg the research report in thi paper wa support in part by contract number 55-000720, a
