realist cognit load model for enhanc share mental model in human-agent collabor xiaocong fan colleg of inform scienc and technolog the pennsylvania state univers univers park, pa 16802 zfan@ist.psu.edu john yen colleg of inform scienc and technolog the pennsylvania state univers univers park, pa 16802 jyen@ist.psu.edu abstract human team member often develop share expect to predict each other"s need and coordin their behavior. in thi paper the concept share belief map is propos as a basi for develop realist share expect among a team of human-agent-pair (hap). the establish of share belief map reli on inter-agent inform  share, the effect of which highli depend on agent"  process load and the instantan cognit load of their human partner. we investig hmm-base cognit load model to facilit team member to share the right  inform with the right parti at the right time. the share belief map concept and the cognit/process load model have been implement in a cognit agent  architecturesmmal. a seri of experi were conduct to evalu the concept, the model, and their impact on the evolv of share mental model of hap team. categori and subject descriptor i.2.11 [artifici intellig]: distribut artifici  intellig-intellig agent, multiag system gener term design, experiment, human factor 1. introduct the entir movement of agent paradigm wa spawn, at least in part, by the perceiv import of foster human-like adjust autonomi. human-center  multiag teamwork ha thu attract increas attent in multi-agent system field [2, 10, 4]. human and autonom system (agent) ar gener thought to be  complementari: while human ar limit by their cognit capac in inform process, thei ar superior in spatial,  heurist, and analog reason; autonom system can  continu learn expertis and tacit problem-solv  knowledg from human to improv system perform. in short, human and agent can team togeth to achiev better  perform, given that thei could establish certain mutual awar to coordin their mix-initi activ. howev, the foundat of human-agent collabor keep be challeng becaus of nonrealist model of mutual awar of the state of affair. in particular, few research look beyond to assess the principl of model share mental construct between a human and hi/her  assist agent. moreov, human-agent relationship can go beyond partner to team. mani inform process limit of individu can be allevi by have a group perform task. although group also can creat addit cost center on commun, resolut of conflict, and social accept, it is suggest that such limit can be overcom if peopl have share cognit structur for  interpret task and social requir [8]. therefor, there is a clear demand for investig to broaden and deepen our understand on the principl of share mental  model among member of a mix human-agent team. there ar line of research on multi-agent teamwork, both theoret and empir. for instanc, joint intent [3] and sharedplan [5] ar two theoret framework for specifi agent collabor. on of the drawback is that, although both have a deep philosoph and  cognit root, thei do not accommod the model of  human team member. cognit studi suggest that team which have share mental model ar expect to have  common expect of the task and team, which allow them to predict the behavior and resourc need of team  member more accur [14, 6]. cannon-bower et al. [14] explicitli argu that team member should hold compat model that lead to common expect. we agre on thi and believ that the establish of share  expect among human and agent team member is a critic step to advanc human-center teamwork research. it ha to be note that the concept of share expect can broadli includ role assign and it dynam,  teamwork schema and progress, commun pattern and intent, etc. while the long-term goal of our research is to understand how share cognit structur can enhanc human-agent team perform, the specif object of the work report here is to develop a comput cognit 395 978-81-904262-7-5 (rp) c 2007 ifaama capac model to facilit the establish of share  expect. in particular, we argu that to favor  humanag collabor, an agent system should be design to allow the estim and predict of human teammat" (rel) cognit load, and us that to offer improvis, unintrus help. ideal, be abl to predict the  cognit/process capac curv of teammat could allow a team member to help the right parti at the right time, avoid unbalanc work/cognit load among the team. the last point is on the model itself. although an agent"s cognit model of it human peer is not necessarili to be descript accur, have at least a realist model can be benefici in offer unintrus help, bia  reduct, as well as trustabl and self-adjust autonomi. for exampl, although human" us of cognit simplif mechan (e.g., heurist) doe not alwai lead to error in judgment, it can lead to predict bias in respons [8]. it is feasibl to develop agent as cognit aid to  allevi human" bias, as long as an agent can be train to obtain a model of a human"s cognit inclin. with a realist human cognit model, an agent can also better adjust it autom level. when it human peer is  becom overload, an agent can take over resourc-consum task, shift the human"s limit cognit resourc to task where a human"s role is indispens. when it  human peer is underload, an agent can take the chanc to observ the human"s oper to refin it cognit model of the human. mani studi have document that human choic and behavior do not agre with predict from ration model. if agent could make recommend in wai that human appreci, it would be easier to establish trust relationship between agent and human; thi in turn, will encourag human" autom us. the rest of the paper is organ as follow. in section 2 we review cognit load theori and measur. a hmm-base cognit load model is given in section 3 to support resourc-bound teamwork among  human-agentpair. section 4 describ the kei concept share belief map as implement in smmall, and section 5 report the experi for evalu the cognit model and their impact on the evolv of share mental model. 2. cognit capac-overview peopl ar inform processor. most cognit  scientist [8] believ that human inform-process system consist of an execut compon and three main  inform store: (a) sensori store, which receiv and retain inform for on second or so; (b) work (or  shortterm) memori, which refer to the limit capac to hold (approxim seven element at ani on time [9]), retain (for sever second), and manipul (two or three  inform element simultan) inform; and (c)  longterm memori, which ha virtual unlimit capac [1] and contain a huge amount of accumul knowledg organ as schemata. cognit load studi ar, by and larg,  concern about work memori capac and how to  circumv it limit in human problem-solv activ such as learn and decis make. accord to the cognit load theori [11], cognit load is defin as a multidimension construct repres the load that a particular task impos on the perform. it ha a causal dimens includ causal factor that can be characterist of the subject (e.g. expertis level), the task (e.g. task complex, time pressur), the environ (e.g. nois), and their mutual relat. it also ha an  assess dimens reflect the measur concept of  mental load (impos exclus by the task and environment demand), mental effort (the cognit capac actual  alloc to the task), and perform. lang"s inform-process model [7] consist of three major process: encod, storag, and retriev. the  encod process select map messag in sensori store that ar relev to a person"s goal into work memori; the storag process consolid the newli encod  inform into chunk, and form associ and schema to  facilit subsequ recal; the retriev process search the associ memori network for a specif element/schema and reactiv it into work memori. the model  suggest that process resourc (cognit capac) ar  independ alloc to the three process. in addit, work memori is us both for hold and for  process inform [1]. due to limit capac, when greater effort is requir to process inform, less capac  remain for the storag of inform. henc, the alloc of the limit cognit resourc ha to be balanc in  order to enhanc human perform. thi come to the issu of measur cognit load, which ha proven difficult for cognit scientist. cognit load can be assess by measur mental load, mental effort, and perform us rate scale,  psychophysiolog (e.g. measur of heart activ, brain  activ, ey activ), and secondari task techniqu [12].  selfrat mai appear question and restrict, especi when instantan load need to be measur over time. although physiolog measur ar sometim highli  sensit for track fluctuat level of cognit load, cost and work place condit often favor task- and  performancebas techniqu, which involv the measur of a secondari task as well as the primari task under consider.  secondari task techniqu ar base on the assumpt that perform on a secondari task reflect the level of  cognit load impos by a primari task [15]. from the resourc alloc perspect, assum a fix cognit capac, ani increas in cognit resourc requir by the primari task must inevit decreas resourc avail for the  secondari task [7]. consequ, perform in a secondari task deterior as the difficulti or prioriti of the primari task increas. the level of cognit load can thu be  manifest by the secondari task perform: the subject is get overload if the secondari task perform drop. a secondari task can be as simpl as detect a visual or auditori signal but requir sustain attent. it  perform can be measur in term of reaction time, accuraci, and error rate. howev, on import drawback of  secondari task perform, as note by paa [12], is that it can interfer consider with the primari task  (compet for limit capac), especi when the primari task is complex. to better understand and measur cognit load, xie and salvendi [16] introduc a conceptu framework, which distinguish instantan load, peak load,  accumul load, averag load, and overal load. it seem that the notat of instantan load, which repres the  dynam of cognit load over time, is especi us for monitor the fluctuat trend so that free capac can be exploit at the most appropri time to enhanc the overal perform in human-agent collabor. 396 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) agent n human human-agent pair n agent 1 human human-agent pair 1

ar limit inform processor, and so ar  intellig agent system; thi is especi true when thei act under hard or soft time constraint impos by the domain problem. in respect to our goal to build realist  expect among teammat, we take two import step. first, agent ar resourc-bound; their process  capac is limit by comput resourc, infer  knowledg, concurr task capabl, etc. we withdraw the assumpt that an agent know all the inform/intent commun from other teammat. instead, we contend that due to limit process capac, an agent mai onli have opportun to process (make sens of) a portion of the incom inform, with the rest ignor. take thi approach will larg chang the wai in which an agent view (model) the involv and cooper of it teammat in a team activ. in other word, the  establish of share mental model regard team member" belief, intent, and respons can no longer reli on inter-agent commun onli. thi be said, we ar not drop the assumpt that teammat ar trustabl. we still stick to thi, onli that team member cannot  overtrust each other; an agent ha to consid the possibl that it inform be share with other might not be as effect as expect due to the recipi" limit  process capac. second, human teammat ar bound by their cognit capac. as far as we know, the research report here is the first attempt in the area of  humancent multi-agent teamwork that realli consid  build and us human"s cognit load model to facilit teamwork involv both human and agent. we us hi, ai to denot human-agent-pair (hap) i. 3.1 comput cognit capac model an intellig agent be a cognit aid, it is desir that the model of it human partner implement within the agent is cognit-accept, if not descript  accur. of cours, build a cognit load model that is cognit-accept is not trivial; there exist a varieti of cognit load theori and differ measur techniqu. we here choos to focu on the perform variabl of secondari task, given the ampl evid support  secondari task perform as a highli sensit and reliabl techniqu for measur human"s cognit load [12]. it"s worth note that just for the purpos of estim a  human subject"s cognit load, ani artifici task (e.g, press a button in respons to unpredict stimuli) can be us as a secondari task to forc the subject to go through.  howev, in a realist applic, we have to make sure that the select secondari task interact with the primari task in meaning wai, which is not easi and often depend on the domain problem at hand. for exampl, in the experi below, we us the number of newli avail inform correctli recal as the secondari task, and the  effect0 1 2 3 4 neglig slightli

primari task. thi is realist to intellig worker becaus in time stress  situat thei have to know what inform to share in order to effect establish an awar of the global pictur. in the follow, we adopt the hidden markov model (hmm) approach [13] to model human"s cognit  capac. it is thu assum that at each time step the secondari task perform of a human subject in a team compos of human-agent-pair (hap) is observ to all the team member. human team member" secondari task  perform is us for estim their hidden cognit load. a hmm is denot by λ = n, v, a, b, π , where n is a set of hidden state, v is a set of observ symbol, a is a set of state transit probabl distribut, b is a set of observ symbol probabl distribut (on for each hidden state), and π is the initi state distribut. we consid a 5-state hmm model of human cognit load as follow (figur 2). the hidden state ar 0  (negligiblyload), 1 (slightli-load), 2 (fairli-load), 3  (heavilyload), and 4 (overli load). the observ state ar ti with secondari task perform, which, in thi studi, is measur in term of the number of item correctli  recal. accord to miller"s 7±2 rule, the observ state take integ valu from 0 to 9 ( the state is 9 when the number of item correctli recal is no less than 9). for the exampl b matrix given in fig. 2, it is veri like that the cognit load of the subject is neglig when the number of item correctli recal is larger than 9. howev, to determin the current hidden load statu of a human partner is not trivial. the model might be  oversensit if we onli consid the last-step secondari task perform to locat the most like hidden state. there is ampl evid suggest that human cognit load is a continu function over time and doe not manifest  sudden shift unless there is a fundament chang in task demand. to address thi issu, we place a constraint on the state transit coeffici: no jump of more than 2 state ar allow. in addit, we take the posit that, a human subject is veri like overload if hi secondari task perform is mostli low in recent time step, while he is veri like not overload if hi secondari task  perform is mostli high recent. thi lead to the follow window-hmm approach. given a pre-train hmm λ of human cognit load and the recent observ sequenc ot of length w, let  paramet w be the effect window size, ελ t be the estim hidden state at time step t. first appli the hmm to the observ sequenc to find the optim sequenc of hidden state sλ t = s1s2 · · · sw (viterbi algorithm). then, comput the estim hidden state ελ t for the current time step,  view it as a function of sλ t . we consid all the hidden state in sλ t , weight by their respect distanc to ελ t−1 (the  estim state of the last step): the closer of a state in sλ t the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 397 to ελ t−1, the higher probabl of the state be ελ t . ελ t is set to be the state with the highest probabl (note that a state mai have multipl appear in sλ t ). more formal, the probabl of state s ∈ s be ελ t is given by: pλ(s, t) = s=sj ∈sλ t η(sj)e−|sj −ελ t−1| , (1) where η(sj) = ej / w k=1 ek is the weight of sj ∈ sλ t (the most recent hidden state ha the most signific influenc in predict the next state). the estim state for the current step is the state with maximum likelihood: ελ t = argmax s∈sλ t pλ(s, t) (2) 3.2 agent process load model accord to schema theori [11], multipl element of  inform can be chunk as singl element in cognit schema. a schema can hold a huge amount of inform, yet is process as a singl unit. we adapt thi idea and  assum that agent i"s estim of agent j"s process load at time step t is a function of two factor: the number of chunk cj(t) and the total number sj(t) of inform  be consid by agent j. if cj(t) and sj(t) ar observ to agent i, agent i can emploi a window-hmm approach as describ in section 3.1 to model and estim agent j"s instantan process load. in the studi report below, we also us 5-state hmm model for agent process load. with the 5 hidden state similar to the hmm model adopt for human cognit load, we emploi multivari gaussian observ  probabl distribut for the hidden state. 3.3 hap"s process load model as discuss abov, a human-agent-pair (hap) is view as a unit when team up with other hap. the process load of a hap can thu be model as the co-effect of the process load of the agent and the cognit load of the human partner as captur by the agent. suppos agent ai ha model for it process load and it human partner hi"s cognit load. denot the agent process load and human cognit load of hap hi, ai at time step t by μi t and νi t, respect. agent ai can us μi t and νi t to estim the load of hi, ai as a whole. similarli, if μj t and νj t ar observ to agent ai, it can estim the load of hj, aj . for model simplic, we still us 5-state hmm model for hap process load, with the estim hidden state of the correspond agent process load and human cognit load as the input observ vector. build a load estim model is the mean. the goal is to us the model to enhanc inform share  perform so that a team can form better share mental model (e.g., to develop inter-agent role expect in their  collabor), which is the kei to high team perform. 3.4 load-sensit inform process each agent ha to adopt a certain strategi to process the incom inform. as far as resourc-bound agent ar concern, it is of no us for an agent to share  inform with teammat who ar alreadi overload; thei simpli do not have the capac to process the inform. consid the incom inform process strategi as shown in tabl 1. agent ai (of hapi) ignor all the  incom inform when it is overload, and process all the incom inform when it is neglig load. when it tabl 1: incom inform process strategi hapi load strategi overli ignor all share info heavili consid everi teammat a ∈ [1, 1 q |q| ], randomli process half amount of info from a; ignor info from ani teammat b ∈ ( 1 q |q|, |q|] fairli process half of share info from ani teammat slightli process all info from ani a ∈ [1, 1 q |q| ]; for ani teammat b ∈ ( 1 q |q|, |q|] randomli process half amount of info from b neglig process all share info hapj process all info from hapj if it is overload *q is a fifo queue of agent from whom thi hap ha receiv inform at the current step; q is a constant known to all. is heavili load, ai randomli process half of the messag from those agent which ar the first 1/q teammat  appear in it commun queue; when it is fairli load, ai randomli process half of the messag from ani  teammat; when it is slightli load, ai process all the  messag from those agent which ar the first 1/q teammat appear in it commun queue, and randomli  process half of the messag from other teammat. to further encourag share inform at the right time, the last row of tabl 1 sai that hapi , if have not sent inform to hapj who is current overload, will  process all the inform from hapj . thi can be justifi from resourc alloc perspect: an agent can realloc it comput resourc reserv for commun to  enhanc it capac of process inform. thi strategi favor never send inform to an overload  teammat, and it suggest that estim and exploit  other" load can be critic to enabl an agent to share the right inform with the right parti at the right time. 4. system implement smmall (share mental model for all) is a cognit agent architectur develop for support human-centric collabor comput. it stress human"s role in team activ by mean of novel collabor concept and  multipl represent of context woven through all aspect of team work. here we describ two compon pertin to the experi report in section 5: multi-parti  commun and share mental map (a complet descript of the smmall system is beyond the scope of thi paper). 4.1 multi-parti commun multi-parti commun refer to convers  involv more than two parti. asid from the speaker, the  listen involv in a convers can be classifi into  variou role such as addresse (the direct listen), auditor (the intend listen), overhear (the unintend but  anticip listen), and eavesdropp (the unanticip listen). multi-parti commun is on of the  characterist of human team. smmall agent, which can form human-agent-pair with human partner, support  multiparti commun with the follow featur. 1. smmall support a collect of multi-parti  perform such as minform (multi-parti inform), mannounc (multi-parti announc), and mask (multi-parti ask). the listen of a multi-parti perform can be addresse,  auditor, and overhear, which correspond to ‘to", ‘cc", and ‘bcc" in e-mail term, respect. 2. smmall support channel-commun. there 398 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) ar three built-in channel: agenttalk channel (inter-agent activ-specif commun), control channel (meta  commun for team coordin), and world channel  (commun with the extern world). an agent can fulli tune to a channel to collect messag sent (or cc, bcc) to it. an agent can also partial tune to a channel to get statist inform about the messag commun over the channel. thi is particularli us if an agent want to know the commun load impos on a teammat. 4.2 share belief map & load displai a concept share belief map ha been propos and  implement into smmall; thi respond to the need to seek innov perspect or concept that allow group  member to effect repres and reason about share mental model at differ level of abstract. as describ in  section 5, human and agent interact through share belief map in the evalu of hmm-base load model. a share belief map is a tabl with color-code  info-cellscel associ with inform. each row captur the belief model of on team member, and each column  correspond to a specif inform type (all column togeth defin the boundari of the inform space be  consid). thu, info-cell cij of a map encod all the belief (instanc) of inform type j held by agent i. color code appli to each info-cell to indic the number of inform instanc held by the correspond agent. the concept of share belief map help maintain and present a human partner with a synergi view of the share mental model evolv within a team. briefli, smmall ha implement the concept with the follow featur: 1. a context menu can be pop up for each info-cell to view and share the associ inform instanc. it allow select (select subset) or holist info-share. 2. mix-initi info-share: both agent and human partner can initi a multi-parti convers. it also  allow third-parti info-share, sai, a share the inform held by b with c. 3. inform type that ar semant relat (e.g., by infer rule) can be close organ. henc, nearbi info-cell can form meaning plateau (or contour line) of similar color. color plateau indic those section of a share mental model that bear high overlap degre. 4. the percept color (hue) differ manifest from a share belief map indic the inform differ among team member, and henc visual repres the potenti inform need of each team member (see figur 3). smmall ha also implement the hmm-base model (section 3) to allow an agent to estim it human  partner"s and other team member" cognit/process load. as shown in fig. 3, below the share belief map there is a load displai for each team member. there ar 2 curv in a displai: the blue (dark) on plot human"s instantan cognit load and the red on plot the process load of a hap as a whole. if there ar n team member, each agent need to maintain 2n hmm-base model to support the load displai. the human partner of a hap can adjust her cognit load at runtim, as well as monitor anoth hap"s agent process load and it probabl of process the inform she send at the current time step. thu, the more close a hap can estim the actual process load of other hap, the better inform share perform the hap can achiev. figur 3: share mental map displai in sum, share belief map allow the infer of who need what, and load displai allow the judgment of when to share inform. togeth thei allow us to investig the impact of share the right info. with the right parti at the right time on the evolv of share mental model. 4.3 metric for share mental model we here describ how we measur team perform in our experi. we us mental model overlap  percentag (mmop) as the base to measur share mental model. mmop of a group is defin as the intersect of all the individu mental state rel to the union of  individu mental state of the group. formal, given a group of k agent g = {ai|1 ≤ i ≤ k}, let bi = {iim|1 ≤ m ≤ n} be the belief (inform) held by agent ai, where each iim is a set of inform of the same type, and n (the size of inform space) is fix for the agent in g, then mmop(g) = 100 n 1≤m≤n ( | ∩1≤i≤k iim| | ∪1≤i≤k iim| ). (3) first, a share mental model can be measur in term of the distanc of averag subgroup mmop to the mmop of the whole group. without lose gener, we defin pair smm distanc (subgroup of size 2) d2 as: d2 (g) = 1≤i<j≤k (mmop({ai, aj}) − mmop(g))2 . (4) the mmop of a subgroup is alwai larger than the mmop of the whole group. intuit, the larger distanc from the mmop of a subgroup to that of the whole group, the more overlap mental model the subgroup share. thi  notion can be us to measur the tight of an emerg subgroup or guid the process of team coalit. second, due to commun or inform process limit, each individu"s subject measur of the group"s mmop can be veri differ from the group"s mmop  measur object from extern. a share mental model can thu be measur in term of the close of individu" measur of the group"s mmop to the object measur. let mmop(g) and m mopi(g) be the object measur and agent ai"s subject measur of the group"s share mental model, respect. we defin smm deviat d⊥ as: d⊥(g) = 1≤i≤k (mmopi(g) − mmop(g))2 .

each time step last 15 second. a time step start with certain  infocel of the share belief map be flash quickli (for 2 s). the flash cell ar exactli those with newli avail inform that should be share at that time step. an info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step: the associ inform is no longer sharabl. thi requir that the newli avail inform be share in time, not later. the human and agent of a hap assum differ role. an agent govern group commun and process  messag to updat the share belief map on it displai. an agent, with a pre-train hmm-base cognit load model for it human partner and a process load model for each of the other hap in the team, also estim and displai their instantan load. human subject need to perform a primari task and a secondari task. the secondari task of a human subject is to rememb and mark the cell be flash (not necessarili in the exact order) by left mous click. secondari task perform at step t is thu  measur as the number of cell mark (rememb) correctli at t, which is taken as the observ state of the  hmmbase cognit load model of that human subject. the primari task of a human subject is to build a share mental model of the dynam situat by share the right  inform with the right parti at the right time. to share the inform associ with an info-cell, a human subject need to click the right mous button on the cell, and select the receiv teammat(s) from the popup menu. there ar cost associ with inform share.  commun among hap is done by the correspond  smmall agent, which have both limit capac nin for  process incom inform and limit outgo  commun capac nout. thu, depend on the current hap load, an agent mai randomli ignor part or all of the  incom inform (have no effect on the establish of share mental model). on the other hand, each time step at most nout number of inform-share command can be effect; more than that contribut noth to the  establish of share mental model. send inform to an overload teammat will wast the capac that  otherwis can be us to share inform with a less load teammat. thi mean that at each time step a human  subject ha to carefulli go through three cognit decis: whether the inform under consider need to be share (i.e., whether it is associ with an info-cell just flash), whether a team member is the right parti to share the inform with (i.e., whether it realli need the  inform), and whether thi is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is current overload). the abov descript appli to hap team. for team compos of smmall agent onli, the agent will take all the role plai by an agent or a human partner in hap team. 5.2 experi design to investig the impact of the hmm-base load model on the evolut of share mental model (smm), we  conduct experi for both agent team and hap team, where agent team involv agent process load model onli, hap team involv model of hap process load (i.e., the co-effect of agent process load and human  cognit load). to get insight on how load predict and multi-parti commun mai affect the perform of form smm, we design 3 agent team (ta1, ta2, ta3) and 3 hap team (th1, th2, th3), where all agent adopt the strategi in tabl 1 to send and process inform. when share inform, team of type 1 (ta1, th1) ignor load predict; team of type 2 (ta2, th2)  consid load predict; team of type 3 (ta3, th3) follow load predict more strictli in the sens that the agent will further group the receiv of a multi-parti messag (minform) by their load and split the messag into  multipl messag with their receiv have the same load. for exampl, given that agent a1, a2, a3 have load 1, 2, 1, respect. an agent a0 in a team of ta2 mai send on multi-parti messag, while an agent a0 in a team of ta3 will send two messag (on to a2, on to a1 and a3). in addit, we control agent" outgo commun capac by vari from 6, 8, to 10. due to constraint on commun capac and  process capac, an agent can be inaccur when track other teammat" mental model. in order to measur the actual share mental model, a special smmall agent name ‘omnial" wa ad to each team to monitor inter-agent commun and record the actual effect of  inform share on each agent"s mental model. thi realiz a wai, as suggest by klimoski [6], to measur the degre of overlap in immedi, intermedi, and long-term situat awar zone held by group member. we also record instantan inform share  util, which is defin as follow. at each time step, let t = t0, t1, t2, t3, t4 be a sequenc of set, where t0, t1, t2, t3, and t4 ar set of teammat whose current load state ar neglig, slightli, fairli, heavili, and overli  respect. let s be the set of inform-share  command issu by a human partner at the current step. let mi = {tk ∈ t|k ≤ i, tk = ∅}. instantan info-share util is defin as c∈s s valu(c)/|s|, where s valu(c) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0 receiv(c) ∈ t4 0 c is known to receiv(c) 1/|mi| receiv(c) ∈ ti, i = 4 (6) in sum, thi studi involv 18 type of team, each team had 4 member, and each team type wa test by 10 domain scenario. 30 human subject were recruit for hap team. the experi result ar plot in figur 4, 6, and 7. we next present our find in thi studi. 5.3 load estim better info-share 400 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 evolut of share mental model of agent team time step percentageofsmm(%) ta1−6 ta1−8 ta1−10 ta2−6 ta2−8 ta2−10 ta3−6 ta3−8 ta3−10 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 time step percentageofsmm(%) evolut of share mental model of hap team th1−6 th1−8 th1−10 th2−6 th2−8 th2−10 th3−6 th3−8 th3−10 noshar figur 4: evolut of smm. consid team of type 1 (ta1, th1) and team of type 2 (ta2, th2). first look at the perform of hap team in fig. 4, we have: (1) for each team type, the perform (percentag of smm overtim) averag over 10 team  increas as commun capac increas  (th1-6<th18<th1-10, th2-6<th2-8<th2-10). (2) the averag  perform of th2 team perform consist better than the th1 team for each capac set (th2-6>th1-6, th2-8>th1-8, th2-10>th1-10), and the perform  differ of th1 and th2 team increas as commun capac increas. thi indic that, other thing be equal, the benefit of exploit load estim when share inform becom more signific when commun capac is larger. from fig. 4 the same find can be deriv for the perform of agent team. in addit, the result also show that the smm of each team type were maintain steadili at a certain level after about 20 time step. howev, to maintain a smm steadili at a certain level is a non-trivial team task. the perform of team who did not share ani inform (the ‘noshar" curv in fig. 4) decreas constantli as time proceed. 5.4 multi-parti commun for smm we now compar team of type 2 and type 3 (which split multi-parti messag by receiv" load). as plot in fig. 4, for hap team, the perform of team type 2 for each fix commun capac wa consist better than team type 3 (th3-6≤th2-6, th3-8<th2-8,  th3-10<th210); the differ becam more signific as  commun capac increas. these also hold for the agent team (upper on in fig. 4). actual, the perform of type 3 (a) (b) a b c minform i a b c inform i inform i inform i figur 5: multi-parti messag. agent team wa even wors (for each fix capac) than the perform of type 1 agent team. thi can be explain by the differ of two-parti and multi-parti commun. in smmall, in order to enabl team-level infer, each agent maintain an intern model of everi team member"s mental model (belief). accord to the semant of minform (multi-parti inform), when a minform i to other, assum all the receiv and  overhear will accept i, a will updat it intern model of their belief; each of the receiv (overhear), upon  get the messag, will updat it own belief as well as it model of the sender"s and all the other receiv" belief. compar to two-parti perform, multi-parti  perform ar prefer for form share mental model. as illustr in fig. 5(a), agent a onli need to perform minform onc (with b and c be receiv) to achiev the common knowledg of the share belief about i (it  consum 2 of a"s commun resourc, on for each  receiv). howev, to achiev the same effect us inform (fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level smm especi when the team size is big (miss on inform will nullifi all other" effort). moreov, although agent a still consum 2, the whole team need more resourc (3 in thi case). howev, split multi-parti messag by receiv" load doe enhanc subgroup smm. in fig. 6 we plot the other two measur of smm (distanc and close as defin in sec. 4.3). for hap team, th3>th2>th1 hold in fig. 6(c) (larger distanc indic better  subgroup smm), and th3<th2<th1 hold in fig. 6(d) (smaller deviat indic higher coher of the whole team). thu, hap team of type 3 achiev better subgroup smm, and their team member had higher coher view of group smm than team of other type. for agent team, th3>th1>th2 hold in fig. 6(a), and th2<th3<th1 hold in fig. 6(b). thu, agent team of type 3 achiev better subgroup smm, and their team member had much higher coher view of group smm than team of type 1 (although slightli wors than team type 2). henc, gener, multi-parti commun encourag the form/evolv of team smm. when a group of agent can be partit into subteam, split messag by their load can be more effect for subteam smm. 5.5 the hmm-base cognit model to valid the hmm-base cognit load model is  extrem difficult becaus detect the real, nois-resist cognit load of human be is far beyond the current technolog. as an indirect judgment, we plot the  regress fit line for the mean of inform share util of hap team with and without load displai. for the hap team with load displai there is a strong neg linear relationship between info-share util and cognit load level (pearson correl coeffici is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with p-valu = 0.014). becaus the info-share util measur and the cognit load measur ar indic of primari task perform and secondari task perform, respect, their linear relationship compli with  cognit studi that secondari task perform can be us the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 401 agent team: distanc from group smm to pair smm (averag) 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45time step distanc agent team: sum deviat of group smm from individu perspect 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45time step deviat ta1 ta2 ta3 hap team: distanc from group smm to pair smm (averag) 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45time step distanc hap team: sum deviat of group smm from individu perspect 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45time step deviat th1 th2 th3 (a) (b) (c) (d) figur 6: the distanc of subgroup smm and the close of individu view of team smm. to explain primari task perform. howev, for team without load displai there is a strong quadrat rather than linear relationship (correl coeffici is √ 0.974 = 0.987 with p-valu = 0.015). thi indic that the inform share perform of a hap team can be significantli  affect by both the human subject"s own cognit load, and the awar of other team member" load. know of  other" load (by estim) will reduc the quadrat relat to a linear relat. figur 7: info-share util by cognit load. 6. conclus recent research attent on human-center teamwork highli demand the design of agent system as cognit aid that can model and exploit human partner" cognit capac to offer help unintrus. in thi paper, we  investig sever factor surround the challeng  problem of evolv share mental model of team compos of human-agent-pair. the major contribut of thi research includ (1) hmm-base load model were propos for an agent to estim it human partner"s cognit load and other hap teammat" process load;
