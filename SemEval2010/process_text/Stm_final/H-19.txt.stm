analyz featur trajectori for event detect qi he qihe@pmail.ntu.edu.sg kuiyu chang askychang@ntu.edu.sg ee-peng lim aseplim@ntu.edu.sg school of comput engin nanyang technolog univers block n4, nanyang avenu, singapor 639798 abstract we consid the problem of analyz word trajectori in both time and frequenc domain, with the specif goal of identifi import and less-report, period and  aperiod word. a set of word with ident trend can be group togeth to reconstruct an event in a complet  unsupervis manner. the document frequenc of each word across time is treat like a time seri, where each element is the document frequenc - invers document frequenc (dfidf) score at on time point. in thi paper, we 1) first appli spectral analysi to categor featur for differ event characterist: import and less-report, period and aperiod; 2) model aperiod featur with gaussian densiti and period featur with gaussian mixtur  densiti, and subsequ detect each featur"s burst by the truncat gaussian approach; 3) propos an unsupervis greedi event detect algorithm to detect both aperiod and period event. all of the abov method can be  appli to time seri data in gener. we extens  evalu our method on the 1-year reuter new corpu [3] and show that thei were abl to uncov meaning aperiod and period event. categori and subject descriptor: h.3.3  [inform storag and retriev]: inform search and  retriev gener term: algorithm, experiment. 1. introduct there ar more than 4,000 onlin new sourc in the world. manual monitor all of them for import event ha becom difficult or practic imposs. in fact, the topic detect and track (tdt) commun ha for mani year been try to come up with a practic solut to help peopl monitor new effect. unfortun, the holi grail is still elus, becaus the vast major of tdt solut propos for event detect [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] ar either too simplist (base on cosin similar [5]) or impract due to the need to tune a larg number of paramet [9]. the ineffect of current tdt  technolog can be easili illustr by subscrib to ani of the mani onlin new alert servic such as the  industrylead googl new alert [2], which gener more than 50% fals alarm [10]. as further proof, portal like yahoo take a more pragmat approach by requir all machin gener new alert to go through a human oper for confirm befor send them out to subscrib. instead of attack the problem with variat of the same hammer (cosin similar and tfidf), a  fundament understand of the characterist of new stream data is necessari befor ani major breakthrough can be made in tdt. thu in thi paper, we look at new stori and  featur trend from the perspect of analyz a time-seri word signal. previou work like [9] ha attempt to  reconstruct an event with it repres featur. howev, in mani predict event detect task (i.e., retrospect event detect), there is a vast set of potenti featur onli for a fix set of observ (i.e., the obviou burst). of these featur, often onli a small number ar expect to be us. in particular, we studi the novel problem of analyz featur trajectori for event detect,  borrow a well-known techniqu from signal process:  identifi distribut correl among all featur by spectral analysi. to evalu our method, we subsequ propos an unsupervis event detect algorithm for new stream. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 easter april (a) aperiod event 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 unaudit end (b) period event figur 1: featur correl (dfidf:time)  between a) easter and april b) unaudit and end. as an illustr exampl, consid the correl  between the word easter and april from the reuter  corpu1 . from the plot of their normal dfidf in figur 1(a), we observ the heavi overlap between the two word circa 04/1997, which mean thei probabl both belong to the same event dure that time (easter feast). in thi  exampl, the hidden event easter feast is a typic import aperiod event over 1-year data. anoth exampl is given by figur 1(b), where both the word unaudit and end 1 reuter corpu is the default dataset for all exampl. exhibit similar behaviour over period of 3 month. these two word actual origin from the same period event, net incom-loss report, which ar releas quarterli by  publicli list compani. other observ drawn from figur 1 ar: 1) the bursti period of april is much longer than easter, which suggest that april mai exist in other event dure the same period; 2) unaudit ha a higher averag dfidf valu than end, which indic unaudit to be more repres for the underli event. these two exampl ar but the tip of the iceberg among all word trend and correl hidden in a new stream like reuter. if a larg number of them can be uncov, it could significantli aid tdt task. in particular, it indic the signific of mine correl featur for detect correspond event. to summar, we postul that: 1) an event is describ by it  repres featur. a period event ha a list of period featur and an aperiod event ha a list of aperiod  featur; 2) repres featur from the same event share similar distribut over time and ar highli correl; 3) an import event ha a set of activ (larg report) repres featur, wherea an unimport event ha a set of inact (less-report) repres featur; 4) a featur mai be includ by sever event with overlap in time frame. base on these observ, we can  either mine repres featur given an event or detect an event from a list of highli correl featur. in thi  paper, we focu on the latter, i.e., how correl featur can be uncov to form an event in an unsupervis manner. 1.1 contribut thi paper ha three main contribut: • to the best of our knowledg, our approach is the first to categor word featur for heterogen event. specif, everi word featur is categor into on of the follow five featur type base on it power spectrum strength and period: 1) hh (high power and high/long period): import aperiod event, 2) hl (high power and low period): import  period event, 3) lh (low power and high period): unimport aperiod event, 4) ll (low power and low period): non-event, and 5) sw (stopword), a higher power and period subset of ll compris stopword, which contain no inform. • we propos a simpl and effect mixtur  densitybas approach to model and detect featur burst. • we come up with an unsupervis event detect  algorithm to detect both aperiod and period event. our algorithm ha been evalu on a real new stream to show it effect. 2. relat work thi work is larg motiv by a broader famili of problem collect known as topic detect and  track (tdt) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10]. moreov, most tdt research so far ha been concern with cluster/classifi document into topic type, identifi novel sentenc [6] for new event, etc., without much regard to analyz the word trajectori with respect to time. swan and allan [18] first attempt us co-occur term to construct an event. howev, thei onli consid name entiti and noun phrase pair, without consid their period. on the contrari, our paper consid all of the abov. recent, there ha been signific interest in model an event in text stream as a burst of activ by  incorpor tempor inform. kleinberg"s semin work describ how bursti featur can be extract from text stream us an infinit automaton model [12], which  inspir a whole seri of applic such as kumar"s  identif of bursti commun from weblog graph [13], mei"s summar of evolutionari theme in text stream [15], he"s cluster of text stream us bursti featur [11], etc. nevertheless, none of the exist work specif identifi featur for event, except for fung et al. [9], who cluster busti featur to identifi variou bursti event. our work differ from [9] in sever wai: 1) we analyz everi  singl featur, not onli bursti featur; 2) we classifi featur along two categor dimens (period and power), yield altogeth five primari featur type; 3) we do not restrict each featur to exclus belong to onli on event. spectral analysi techniqu have previous been us by vlacho et al. [19] to identifi period and burst from queri log. their focu wa on detect multipl  period from the power spectrum graph, which were then us to index word for queri-by-burst search. in thi paper, we us spectral analysi to classifi word featur along two dimens, name period and power spectrum, with the ultim goal of identifi both period and aperiod bursti event. 3. data represent let t be the durat/period (in dai) of a new stream, and f repres the complet word featur space in the classic static vector space model (vsm). 3.1 event period classif within t, there mai exist certain event that occur onli onc, e.g., toni blair elect as prime minist of u.k., and other recur event of variou period, e.g., weekli soccer match. we thu categor all event into two type: aperiod and period, defin as follow. definit 1. (aperiod event) an event is aperiod within t if it onli happen onc. definit 2. (period event) if event of a certain event genr occur regularli with a fix period p ≤ t/2 , we sai that thi particular event genr is period, with each member event qualifi as a period event. note that the definit of aperiod is rel, i.e., it is true onli for a given t, and mai be invalid for ani other t > t. for exampl, the event christma feast is aperiod for t ≤ 365 but period for t ≥ 730. 3.2 repres featur intuit, an event can be describ veri concis by a few discrimin and repres word featur and vice-versa, e.g., hurrican, sweep, and strike could be repres featur of a hurrican genr event. likewis, a set of strongli correl featur could be us to  reconstruct an event descript, assum that strongli  correl featur ar repres. the represent vector of a word featur is defin as follow: definit 3. (featur trajectori) the trajectori of a word featur f can be written as the sequenc yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (t)], where each element yf (t) is a measur of featur f at time t, which could be defin us the normal dfidf score2 yf (t) = dff (t) n(t) × log( n dff ), where dff (t) is the number of document (local df)  contain featur f at dai t, dff is the total number of  document (global df) contain featur f over t, n(t) is the number of document for dai t, and n is the total number of document over t. 4. identifi featur for event in thi section, we show how repres featur can be extract for (un)import or (a)period event. 4.1 spectral analysi for domin period given a featur f, we decompos it featur trajectori yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (t)] into the sequenc of t  complex number [x1, . . . , xt ] via the discret fourier  transform (dft): xk = t t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi t (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , t. dft can repres the origin time seri as a linear  combin of complex sinusoid, which is illustr by the invers discret fourier transform (idft): yf (t) = 1 t t k=1 xke 2πi t (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , t, where the fourier coeffici xk denot the amplitud of the sinusoid with frequenc k/t. the origin trajectori can be reconstruct with just the domin frequenc, which can be determin from the power spectrum us the popular periodogram estim. the periodogram is a sequenc of the squar magnitud of the fourier coeffici, xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , t/2 , which indic the signal power at frequenc k/t in the spectrum. from the power spectrum, the domin period is chosen as the invers of the frequenc with the highest power  spectrum, as follow. definit 4. (domin period) the domin period (dp) of a given featur f is pf = t/ arg max k xk 2 . accordingli, we have definit 5. (domin power spectrum) the  domin power spectrum (dp) of a given featur f is sf = xk 2 , with xk 2 ≥ xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 categor featur the dp of a featur trajectori is a strong indic of it activ at the specifi frequenc; the higher the dp, the more like for the featur to be bursti. combin dp with dp, we therefor categor all featur into four type: 2 we normal yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ t i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpret as a probabl. • hh: high sf , aperiod or long-term period (pf > t/2 ); • hl: high sf , short-term period (pf ≤ t/2 ); • lh: low sf , aperiod or long-term period; • ll: low sf , short-term period. the boundari between long-term and short-term period is set to t/2 . howev, distinguish between a high and low dp is not straightforward, which will be tackl later. properti of differ featur set to better understand the properti of hh, hl, lh and ll, we select four featur, christma, soccer, db and your as illustr exampl. sinc the boundari between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen exampl have rel wide rang of power spectrum valu. figur 2(a) show the dfidf trajectori for christma with a distinct burst around christma dai. for the 1-year reuter dataset, christma is classifi as a typic aperiod event with pf = 365 and sf = 135.68, as shown in figur 2(b). clearli, the valu of sf = 135.68 is reason for a well-known bursti event like christma. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) christma(dfidf:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 p=365 s=135.68 (b) christma(s:frequenc) figur 2: featur christma with rel high sf and long-term pf . the dfidf trajectori for soccer is shown in figur 3(a), from which we can observ that there is a regular burst everi 7 dai, which is again verifi by it comput valu of pf = 7, as shown in figur 3(b). us the domain knowledg that soccer game have more match everi saturdai, which make it a typic and heavili report period event, we thu consid the valu of sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(dfidf:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 p=7 s=155.13 (b) soccer(s:frequenc) figur 3: featur soccer with rel high sf and short-term pf . from the dfidf trajectori for db in figur 4(a), we can immedi deduc db to be an infrequ word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 correspond to db land raﬄes hold plan. thi is confirm by the long period of pf = 365 and low power of sf = 0.3084 as shown in figur 4(b). moreov, sinc thi aperiod event is onli report in a few new stori over a veri short time of few dai, we therefor sai that it low power valu of sf = 0.3084 is repres of unimport event. the most confus exampl is shown in figur 5 for the word featur your, which look veri similar to the graph for soccer in figur 3. at first glanc, we mai be tempt to group both your and soccer into the same categori of hl or ll sinc both distribut look similar and have the same domin period of approxim a week. howev, further 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) db(dfidf:time) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 p=365 s=0.3084 (b) db(s:frequenc) figur 4: featur db with rel low sf and long-term pf . analysi indic that the period of your is due to the differ in document count for weekdai (averag 2,919 per dai) and weekend3 (averag 479 per dai). on would have expect the period of a stopword like your to be a dai. moreov, despit our dfidf normal, the weekdai/weekend imbal still prevail; stopword  occur 4 time more frequent on weekend than on weekdai. thu, the dp remain the onli distinguish factor  between your (sf = 9.42) and soccer (sf = 155.13). howev, it is veri danger to simpli conclud that a power valu of s = 9.42 correspond to a stopword featur. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) your(dfidf:time) 0 5 10 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 p=7 s=9.42 (b) your(s:frequenc) figur 5: featur your as an exampl confus with featur soccer. befor introduc our solut to thi problem, let"s look at anoth ll exampl as shown in figur 6 for beenb, which is actual a confirm typo. we therefor classifi beenb as a noisi featur that doe not contribut to ani event. clearli, the trajectori of your is veri differ from beenb, which mean that the former ha to be consid separ. 0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) beenb(dfidf:time) 1.20e-05 1.20e-05 1.20e-05 1.20e-05 1.20e-05 0.003 0.126 0.249 0.373 0.496 p=8 s=1.20e-05 (b) beenb(s:frequenc) figur 6: featur beenb with rel low sf and short-term pf . stop word (sw) featur set base on the abov analysi, we realiz that there must be anoth featur set between hl and ll that correspond to the set of stopword. featur from thi set ha moder dp and low but known domin period. sinc it is hard to distinguish thi featur set from hl and ll onli base on dp, we introduc anoth factor call averag dfidf (dfidf). as shown in figur 5, featur like your usual have a lower dp than a hl featur like soccer, but have a much higher dfidf than anoth ll noisi featur such as beenb. sinc such properti ar usual characterist of stopword, we group featur like your into the newli defin stopword (sw) featur set. sinc set the dp and dfidf threshold for  identifi stopword is more of an art than scienc, we propos a heurist hs algorithm, algorithm 1. the basic idea is to onli us new stori from weekdai to identifi stopword. 3 the weekend here also includ public holidai fall on weekdai. the sw set is initi seed with a small set of 29 popular stopword util by googl search engin. algorithm 1 heurist stopword detect (hs) input: seed sw set, weekdai trajectori of all word 1: from the seed set sw, comput the maximum dp as udp, maximum dfidf as udfidf, and minimum of dfidf as ldfidf. 2: for fi ∈ f do 3: comput dft for fi. 4: if sfi ≤ udp and dfidffi ∈ [ldfidf, udfidf] then 5: fi → sw 6: f = f − fi 7: end if 8: end for overview of featur categor after the sw set is gener, all stopword ar remov from f. we then set the boundari between high and low dp to be the upper bound of the sw set"s dp. an overview of all five featur set is shown in figur 7. figur 7: the 5 featur set for event. 5. identifi burst for featur sinc onli featur from hh, hl and lh ar  meaning and could potenti be repres to some event, we prune all other featur classifi as ll or sw. in thi section, we describ how burst can be identifi from the remain featur. unlik kleinberg"s burst identif algorithm [12], we can identifi both signific and trivial burst without the need to set ani paramet. 5.1 detect aperiod featur" burst for each featur in hh and hl, we truncat it  trajectori by keep onli the bursti period, which is model with a gaussian distribut. for exampl, figur 8 show the word featur iraq with a burst circa 09/06/1996  be model as a gaussian. it bursti period is defin by [μf − σf , μf + σf ] as shown in figur 8(b). 5.2 detect period featur" burst sinc we have comput the dp for a period featur f, we can easili model it period featur trajectori yf us 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 (a) origin dfidf:time 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 burst= [μ-σ, μ+σ] (b) identifi burst figur 8: model iraq"s time seri as a truncat gaussian with μ = 09/06/1996 and σ = 6.26. a mixtur of k = t/pf gaussian: f(yf = yf (t)|θf ) = k k=1 αk 1 2πσ2 k e − 1 2σ2 k (yf (t)−µk)2 , where the paramet set θf = {αk, μk, σk}k k=1 compris: • αk is the probabl of assign yf into the kth  gaussian. αk > 0, ∀k ∈ [1, k] and k k=1 αk = 1; • μk/σk is mean/standard deviat of the kth gaussian. the well known expect maxim (em) [8]  algorithm is us to comput the mix proport αk, as well as the individu gaussian densiti paramet μk and σk . each gaussian repres on period event, and is model similarli as mention in section 5.1. 6. event from featur after identifi and model burst for all featur, the next task is to paint a pictur of the event with a potenti set of repres featur. 6.1 featur correl if two featur fi and fj ar repres of the same event, thei must satisfi the follow necessari condit: 1. fi and fj ar ident distribut: yfi ∼ yfj . 2. fi and fj have a high document overlap. measur featur distribut similar we measur the similar between two featur fi and fj us discret kl-diverg defin as follow. definit 6. (featur similar) kl(fi, fj ) is given by max(kl(fi|fj ), kl(fj |fi)), where kl(fi|fj ) = t t=1 f(yfi (t)|θfi )log f(yfi (t)|θfi ) f(yfj (t)|θfj ) . (1) sinc kl-diverg is not symmetr, we defin the  similar between between fi and fj as the maximum of kl(fi|fj ) and kl(fj |fi). further, the similar between two  aperiod featur can be comput us a close form of the kl-diverg [16]. the same discret kl-diverg  formula of eq. 1 is emploi to comput the similar between two period featur, next, we defin the over similar among a set of  featur r us the maximum inter-featur kl-diverg valu as follow. definit 7. (set"s similar)kl(r) = max ∀fi,fj ∈r kl(fi, fj ). document overlap let mi be the set of all document contain featur fi. given two featur fi and fj , the overlap document set contain both featur is mi ∩ mj . intuit, the higher the |mi ∩ mj |, the more likelti that fi and fj will be highli correl. we defin the degre of document overlap  between two featur fi and fj as follow. definit 8. (featur df overlap) d(fi, fj ) = |mi∩mj| min(|mi|,|mj|) . accordingli, the df overlap among a set of featur r is also defin. definit 9. (set df overlap) d(r) = min ∀fi,fj ∈r d(fi, fj). 6.2 unsupervis greedi event detect we us featur from hh to detect import aperiod event, featur from lh to detect less-report/unimport aperiod event, and featur from hl to detect period event. all of them share the same algorithm. given bursti featur fi ∈ hh, the goal is to find highli correl  featur from hh. the set of featur similar to fi can then collect describ an event. specif, we need to find a subset ri of hh that minim the follow cost function: c(ri) = kl(ri) d(ri) fj ∈ri sfj , ri ⊂ hh. (2) the underli event e (associ with the burst of fi) can be repres by ri as y(e) = fj ∈ri sfj fu∈ri sfu yfj . (3) the burst analysi for event e is exactli the same as the featur trajectori. the cost in eq. 2 can be minim us our  unsupervis greedi ug event detect algorithm, which is  describ in algorithm 2. the ug algorithm allow a featur algorithm 2 unsupervis greedi event detect (ug). input: hh, document index for each featur. 1: sort and select featur in descend dp order: sf1 ≥ sf2 ≥ . . . ≥ sf|hh| .

event onli contain year/month featur (i.e., an event onli contain 1 featur aug could be identifi over a  1year new stream) could be remov, although such event will have inher high cost and should alreadi be rank veri low. note that our ug algorithm onli requir on data-depend paramet, the boundari between high and low power spectrum, to be set onc, and thi paramet can be easili estim us the hs algorithm (algorithm 1). 7. experi in thi section, we studi the perform of our featur categor method and event detect algorithm. we first introduc the dataset and experiment setup, then we  subject evalu the categor of featur for hh, hl, lh, ll and sw. final, we studi the (a)period event detect problem with algorithm 2. 7.1 dataset and experiment setup the reuter corpu contain 806,791 english

time-sensit past/present/futur tens of verb and the differ between lower case noun and upper case name entiti, no stem wa done. sinc dynam stopword remov is on of the function of our method, no stopword wa remov. we did remov  nonenglish charact, howev, after which the number of word featur amount to 423,433. all experi were  implement in java and conduct on a 3.2 ghz pentium 4 pc run window

analyz new stori over 259 weekdai, we comput the upper bound of the power spectrum for stopword at 11.18 and correspond dfidf rang from 0.1182 to 0.3691. ani featur f satisfi sf <= 11.18 and 0.1182 <= dfidff <= 0.3691 over weekdai will be consid a stopword. in thi manner, 470 stopword were found and remov as visual in figur 9. some detect stopword ar a (p = 65, s = 3.36, dfidf = 0.3103), at (p = 259, s = 1.86, dfidf = 0.1551), gmt (p = 130, s = 6.16, dfidf = 0.1628) and much (p = 22, s = 0.80, dfidf = 0.1865). after the remov of these stopword, the distribut of weekdai and weekend new ar more or less match, and in the ensu experi, we shall make us of the full corpu (weekdai and weekend). the upper bound power spectrum valu of 11.18 for  stopword train wa select as the boundari between the

and ll region. 0 5 11.18 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 12879.82 1 2 4 6 8 20 50 100 183 364 365 s(f) p(f) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 lh hh ll hl figur 10: distribut of categor featur over the four quadrant (shade in log scale). follow observ: 1. most featur have low s and ar easili distinguish from those featur have a much higher s, which allow us to detect import (a)period event from trivial event by select featur with high s. 2. featur in the hh and lh quadrant ar aperiod, which ar nice separ (big horizont gap) from the period featur. thi allow reliabl detect aperiod event and period event independ. 3. the (vertic) boundari between high and low power spectrum is not as clearcut and the exact valu will be applic specif. by check the scatter distribut of featur from sw on hh, hl, lh, and ll as shown in figur 9, we found that 87.02%(409/470) of the detect stopword origin from ll. the ll classif and high dfidf score of  stopword agre with the gener accept notion that  stopword ar equal frequent over all time. therefor, set the boundari between high and low power spectrum us the upper bound sf of sw is a reason heurist. 7.3 detect aperiod event we shall evalu our two hypothes, 1)import  aperiod event can be defin by a set of hh featur, and 2)less report aperiod event can be defin by a set of lh featur. sinc no benchmark new stream exist for event detect (tdt dataset ar not proper stream), we evalu the qualiti of the automat detect event by compar them to manual-confirm event by search through the corpu. among the 69 hh featur, we detect 17 import  aperiod event as shown in tabl 1 (e1 − e17). note that the entir identif took less than 1 second, after  remov event contain onli the month featur. among the 17 event, other than the overlap between e3 and e4 (both describ the same hostag event), e11 and e16 (both about compani report), the 14 identifi event ar extrem  accur and correspond veri well to the major event of the period. for exampl, the defeat of bob dole, elect of toni blair, missil attack on iraq, etc. recal that select the featur for on event should minim the cost in eq. 2 such that 1) the number of featur span differ event, and 2) not all featur relev to an event will be select, e.g., the featur clinton is repres to e12 but sinc clinton relat to mani other event, it time domain signal is far differ from those of other repres featur like dole and bob. the number of document of a detect event is roughli estim by the number of index document contain the repres featur. we can see that all 17 import aperiod event ar popularli report event. after 742 minut of comput time, we detect 23, 525 less report aperiod event from 83,471 lh featur.  tabl 1 list the top 5 detect aperiod event (e18 − e22) with respect to the cost. we found that these 5 event ar actual veri trivial event with onli a few new report, and ar usual subsum by some larger topic. for  exampl, e22 is on of the rescu event in an airplan hijack topic. on advantag of our ug algorithm for discov less-report aperiod event is that we ar abl to precis detect the true event period. 7.4 detect period event among the 1,087 hl featur, 330 import period event were detect within 10 minut of comput time. tabl 1 list the top 5 detect period event with respect to the cost (e23 − e27). all of the detect period event ar inde valid, and correspond to real life period event. the gmm model is abl to detect and estim the bursti period nice although it cannot distinguish the slight  differ between everi mondai-fridai and all weekdai as shown in e23. we also notic that e26 is actual a subset of e27 (soccer game), which is accept sinc the sheffield leagu result ar announc independ everi weekend. 8. conclus thi paper took a whole new perspect of analyz featur trajectori as time domain signal. by  consid the word document frequenc in both time and  frequenc domain, we were abl to deriv mani new  characterist about new stream that were previous unknown, e.g., the differ distribut of stopword dure  weekdai and weekend. for the first time in the area of tdt, we appli a systemat approach to automat detect import and less-report, period and aperiod event. the kei idea of our work li in the observ that (a)period event have (a)period repres featur and (un)import event have (in)activ repres  featur, differenti by their power spectrum and time  period. to address the real event detect problem, a simpl and effect mixtur densiti-base approach wa us to identifi featur burst and their associ bursti period. we also design an unsupervis greedi algorithm to  detect both aperiod and period event, which wa success in detect real event as shown in the evalu on a real new stream. although we have not made ani benchmark comparison against anoth approach, simpli becaus there is no  previou work in the address problem. futur work includ evalu the recal of detect event for a label new stream, and compar our model against the closest  equival method, which current ar limit to the method of kleinberg [12] (which can onli detect certain type of bursti event depend on paramet set), fung et al. [9], and swan and allan [18]. nevertheless, we believ our simpl and effect method will be us for all tdt  practition, and will be especi us for the initi exploratori analysi of new stream. 9. refer [1] apach lucen-core 2.0.0, http://lucen.apach.org.
