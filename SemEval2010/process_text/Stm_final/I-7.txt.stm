[. . . ] what we want is a theori that systemat the studi of the variou univers ingredi that make up the move-structur of game; too abstract a model will miss them.

we assum the commit the player can make ar given. despit schell"s warn for too abstract a framework, our approach will be base on the formal notion of an extort, which we will propos in section 4 as a uniform tactic for a comprehens class of situat in which commit can be made sequenti. on thi basi we tackl such issu as the us of certain type of commit in differ situat (strateg game) or whether it is better to commit earli rather than late. we also provid a framework for the assess of more  gener game theoret matter like the relationship of extort to backward induct or pareto effici. insight into these matter ha prove itself invalu for a proper understand of diplomat polici dure the cold war.  nowadai, we believ, these issu ar equal signific for  applic and develop in such field as multiag system,  distribut comput and electron market. for exampl,  commit have been argu to be of import for interact  softwar agent as well as for mechan design. in the former set, the inabl to re-program a softwar agent on the fly can be seen as a commit to it specif and thu exploit to strengthen it strateg posit in a multiag set. a mechan, on the other hand, could be seen as a set of commit that steer the player" behavior in a certain desir wai (see, e.g., [2]). our analysi is conceptu similar to that of stackelberg or leadership game [15], which have been extens studi in the econom literatur (cf., [16]). these game analyz situat in which a leader commit to a pure or mix strategi, and a number of follow, who then act simultan. our approach, howev, differ in that it is assum that the player all move in a  particular order-first, second, third and so on-and that it is specif aim at incorpor a wide rang of possibl commit, in particular condit commit. after briefli discuss relat work in section 2, we present the formal game theoret framework, in which we defin the  notion of a commit type as well as condit and uncondit commit (section 3). in section 4 we propos the gener  concept of an extort, which for each commit type captur the idea of an optim commit profil. we point out an  equival between extort and backward induct solut, and investig whether it is advantag to commit earlier rather than later and how the outcom obtain through extort relat to pareto effici. section 5 briefli review some other  commit type, such as induct, mix and mix condit  commit. the paper conclud with an overview of the result and an outlook for futur research in section 6. 2. relat work commit is a central concept in game theori. the  possibl to make commit distinguish cooper from  noncoop game theori [4, 6]. leadership game, as mention in the introduct, analyz commit to pure or mix  strategi in what is essenti a two-player set [15, 16]. inform, schell [9] ha emphas the import of promis, threat and the like for a proper understand of social interact. on a more formal level, threat have also figur in bargain theori. nash"s threat game [5] and harsanyi"s ration threat [3] ar two import earli exampl. also, commit have plai a  signific role in the theori of equilibrium select (see, e.g., [13]. over the last few year, game theori ha becom almost  indispens as a research tool for comput scienc and (multi)agent research. commit have by no mean gone unnot (see, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 3) (3, 2) (0, 0) (2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ figur 1: commit to a domin strategi can be  advantag. e.g., [1, 11]). recent, also the strateg aspect of commit have attract the attent of comput scientist. thu, conitz and sandholm [2] have studi the comput complex of comput the optim strategi to commit to in normal form and bayesian game. sandholm and lesser [8] emploi level  commit for the design of multiag system in which  contractu agreement ar not fulli bind. anoth connect  between commit and comput scienc ha been point out by samet [7] and tennenholtz [12]. their point of departur is the observ that program can be us to formul commit that ar condit on the program of other system. our approach is similar to the stackleberg set in that we  assum an order in which the player commit. we, howev, consid a number of differ commit type, among which condit commit, and propos a gener solut concept. 3. commit by commit, an agent can improv hi strateg posit. it mai even be advantag to commit to a strategi that is strongli domin, i.e., on for which there is anoth strategi that yield a better payoff no matter how the other agent act. consid for  exampl the 2×2 game in figur 1, in which on player, row, choos row and anoth, col, choos column. the entri in the matrix indic the payoff to row and col, respect. then, top-left is the solut obtain by iter elimin of strongli  domin strategi: for row, plai top is alwai better than plai bottom, and assum that row will therefor never plai bottom, left is alwai better than right for col. howev, if row succe in convinc col of hi commit to plai bottom, the latter had better choos the right column. thu, row attain a payoff of two instead of on. along a similar line of reason, howev, col would wish to commit to the left column, as convinc row of thi commit guarante him the most desir outcom. if, on the other hand, both player actual commit themselv in thi wai but without convinc the other parti of their have done so, the game end in miseri for both. import type of commit, howev, cannot simpli be  analyz as uncondit commit to action. the essenc of a threat, for exampl, is deterr. if success, it is not carri out. (thi is also the reason why the credibl of a threat is not  necessarili undermin if it put into effect mean that the threaten is also harm.) by contrast, promis ar made to entic and, as such, meant to be fulfil. thu, both threat and promis would be strateg void if thei were uncondit. figur 2 show an exampl, in which col can guarante himself a payoff of three by threaten to choos the right column if row choos top. (thi will suffic to deter row, and there is no need for an addit promis on the part of col.) he cannot do so by mere commit uncondition, and neither can row if he were to commit first. in the case of condit commit, howev, a particular kind of inconsist can aris. it is not in gener the case that ani two commit can both be credibl. in a 2 × 2 game, it could occur that row commit condition on plai top if the the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 109 ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 2) (0, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ figur 2: the column player col can guarante himself a payoff of three by threaten to plai right if the row player row plai top. col plai left, and bottom, otherwis. if now, col simultan were abl to commit to the condit strategi to plai right if row plai top, and left, otherwis, there is no strategi profil that can be plai without on of the player" bluff be call. to get around thi problem, on can write down condit  commit in the form of rule and defin appropri fix point construct, as suggest by samet [7] and tennenholtz [12]. sinc check the semant equival of two commit (or commit condit) is undecid in gener, tennenholtz base hi definit of program equilibrium on syntact  equival. we, by contrast, try to steer clear from fix point  construct by assum that the player make their commit in a particular order. each player can then make hi commit  depend on the action of the player to commit after him, but not on the commit of the player that commit befor. on the issu how thi order come about we do not here enter. rather, we assum it to be determin by the circumst, which mai forc or permit some player to commit earlier and other later. we will find that it is not alwai benefici to commit earlier than later or vice versa. anoth point to heed is that we onli consid the case in which the commit ar consid absolut bind. we do not take into account commit that can be violat. intuit, thi could be understood as that the possibl of violat fatal undermin the credibl of the commit. we also assum commit to be complet, in the sens that thei fulli lai down a player"s behavior in all forese circumst. these  assumpt impli that the outcom of the game is entir determin by the commit the player make. although these might be  implaus assumpt for some situat, we had better studi the ideal case first, befor tackl the complic of the more gener case. to make these concept formal precis, we first have to fix some notat. 3.1 strateg game a strateg game is a tupl (n, (ai)i∈n, (ui)i∈n), where n = {1, . . . , n} is a finit set of player, ai is a set of action avail to player i and ui a real-valu util function for player i on the set of (pure) strategi profil s = a1×· · ·×an. we call a game finit if for all player i the action set ai is finit. a mix strategi σi for a player i is a probabl distribut over ai. we write Σi for the set of mix strategi avail to player i, and Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn for the set of mix strategi profil. we further have σ(a) and σi(a) denot the probabl of action a in mix strategi profil σ or mix strategi σi, respect. in set involv expect util, we will gener assum that util function repres von neumann-morgenstern prefer. for a player i and (mix) strategi profil σ and τ we write σ i τ if ui (σ) ui (τ). 3.2 condit commit rel to a strateg game (n, (ai)i∈n, (ui)i∈n) and an  order π = (π1, . . . , πn) of the player, we defin the set fπi of (pure) condit commit of a player πi as the set of function from aπ1 × · · · × aπi−1 to aπi . for π1 we have the set of condit commit coincid with aπ1 . by a condit commit  profil f we understand ani combin of condit commit in fπ1 × · · · × fπn . intuit, π reflect the sequenti order in which the player can make their commit, with πn commit first, πn−1 second, and so on. each player can condit hi action on the action of all player that ar to commit after him. in thi manner, each  condit commit profil f can be seen to determin a uniqu strategi profil, denot by f , which will be plai if all player stick to their condit commit. more formal, the strategi profil f = (fπ1 , . . . , fπn ) for a condit commit profil f is defin induct as fπ1 =df. fπ1 , fπi+1 =df. fπi+1 (fπ1 , . . . , fπi ). the sequenc fπ1 , (fπ1 , fπ2 ), . . . , (fπ1 , . . . , fπn ) will be call the path of f . e.g., in the two-player game of figur 2 and given the  order (row, col), row ha two condit commit, top and bottom, which we will henceforth denot t and b. col, on the other hand, ha four condit commit, correspond to the  differ function map strategi of row to those of col. if we consid a condit commit f for col such that f (t) = l and f (b) = r, then (t, f ) is a condit commit profil and (t, f ) = (t, f (t)) = (t, l). there is a natur wai in which a strateg game g togeth with an order (π1, . . . , πn) of the player can be interpret as an  extens form game with perfect inform (see, e.g., [4, 6])1 , in which π1 choos hi action first, π2 second, and so on. observ that under thi assumpt the strategi in the extens form game and the condit commit in the strateg game g with  order π ar mathemat the same object. appli backward induct to the extens form game yield subgam perfect  equilibria, which arguabl provid appropri solut in thi set. from the perspect of condit commit, howev,  player move in revers order. we will argu that under thi  interpret other strategi profil should be singl out as appropri. to illustr thi point, consid onc more the game in figur 2 and observ that neither player can improv on the outcom  obtain via iter strong domin by commit  uncondition to some strategi. situat like thi, in which player can make uncondit commit in a fix order, can fruitfulli be analyz as extens form game, and the most lucr  uncondit commit can be found through backward induct. figur 3 show the extens form associ with the game of  figur 2. the strategi avail to the row player ar the same as in the strateg form: choos the top or the bottom row. the  strategi for the column player in the extens game ar given by the four function that map strategi of the row player in the  strateg game to on of hi own. transform thi extens form back into a strateg game (see figur 4), we find that there exist a second equilibrium besid the on found by mean of backward induct. thi equilibrium with outcom (1, 3), indic by the thick line in figur 3, ha been argu to be unaccept in the sequenti game as it would involv an incred threat by col: onc row ha plai top, col find himself confront with a fait accompli. he had better make the best of a bad bargain and opt for the left column after all. thi is in essenc the line of thought selten follow in hi famou argument for subgam perfect  equilibria [10]. if, howev, the strategi of col in the extens form ar thought of as hi condit commit he can make in case 1 for a formal definit of a game in extens form, the reader consult on of the standard textbook, such as [4] or [6]. in thi paper all formal definit ar base on strateg game and  order of the player onli. 110 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 2 2 3 1 0 0 1 3 row col figur 3: extens form obtain from the strateg

(the horizont dot line do not indic inform set, but mere indic which player ar to move when.) he move first, the situat is radic differ. thu we also  assum that it is possibl for col to make credibl the threat to choos the right column if row were to plai top, so as to ensur the latter is alwai better off to plai the bottom row. if col can make a  condit commit of plai the right column if row choos top, and the left column otherwis, thi leav row with the easi choic between a payoff of zero or on, and col mai expect a payoff of three. thi line of reason can be gener to yield an  algorithm for find optim condit commit for gener  twoplay game: 1. find a strategi profil s = (sπ1 , sπ2 ) with maximum payoff to player π2, and set fπ1 = sπ1 and fπ2 (sπ1 ) = sπ2 . 2. for each tπ1 ∈ aπ1 with tπ1 sπ1 , find a strategi tπ2 ∈ aπ2 that minim uπ1 (tπ1 , tπ2 ), and set fπ2 (tπ1 ) = tπ2 . 3. if uπ1 (tπ1 , fπ2 (tπ1 )) uπ1 (sπ1 , sπ2 ) for all tπ1 sπ1 , return f . 4. otherwis, find the strategi profil (sπ1 , sπ2 ) with the highest payoff to π2 among the on that have not yet been  consid. set fπ1 = sπ1 and fπ2 (sπ1 ) = sπ2 , and continu with step 2. gener the idea underli thi algorithm, we present in section 4 the concept of an extort, which appli to game with ani number of player. for ani order of the player an extort contain, for each player, an optim commit given the  commit of the player that commit earlier. 3.3 commit type so far, we have distinguish between condit and  uncondit commit. if made sequenti, both of them determin a uniqu strategi profil in a given strateg game. thi notion of sequenti commit allow for gener and give rise to the follow definit of a (sequenti) commit type. definit 3.1.

(extort) let g be a strateg game, π an order of it player, and τ a commit type. let τ(g, π) be given by xπ1 , . . . , xπn , φ . a τ-extort of order 0 is ani  commit profil x ∈ xπ1 × · · · × xπn . for m > 0, a commit profil x ∈ xπ1 × · · · × xπn is a τ-extort of order m in g given π if x is an τ-extort of order m − 1 with φ yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn πm φ xπ1 , . . . , xπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn for all commit profil g in x with (yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) a τ-extort of order m − 1. a τ-extort is a commit profil that is a τ-extort of order m for all m with 0 m n.  furthermor, we sai that a (mix) strategi profil σ is τ-extortion if there is some τ-extort x with φ(x) = s. thu, an extort of order 1 is a commit profil in which player π1, make a commit that maxim hi payoff, given fix commit of the other player. an extort of order m is an extort of order m − 1 that maxim player m"s payoff, given fix commit of the player πm+1 through πn. for the type of condit commit we have that ani  condit commit profil f is an extort of order 0 and an  extort of an order m greater than 0 is ani extort of order m − 1 for which: gπ1 , . . . , gπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn πm fπ1 , . . . , fπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn , for each condit commit profil g such that gπ1 , . . . , gπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn an extort of order m − 1. to illustr the concept of an extort for condit  commit consid the three-player game in figur 5 and assum ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 4, 0) (1, 4, 0) (3, 3, 2) (0, 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (4, 1, 1) (4, 0, 0) (3, 3, 2) (0, 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ figur 5: a three-player strateg game the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 111 ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 1 4 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 3 3 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 4 1 1 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 3 3 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ row col mat ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 1 4 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 4 0 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 0 0 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 0 0 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 1 4 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 3 3 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 4 1 1 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 3 3 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ row col mat ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 1 4 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 4 0 0 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 0 0 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝ 0 0 2 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ figur 6: a condit extort f of order 1 (left) and an extort g of order 3 (right).

[6, p. 99]). in particular, thi result hold if the player" action ar commit of a finit type. fact 4.3. for each finit game and each order of the  player, benign backward induct exist. for each game, each order of it player and each  commit type, we can defin anoth game g∗ with the the action of each player i given by hi τ-commit xi in g. the util 112 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) of a strategi profil (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) for a player i in g∗ can then be equat to hi util of the strategi profil φ(xπn , . . . , xπ1 ) in g. we now find that the extort of g can be retriev as the path of the benign backward induct solut of the game g∗ for the order πr of the player, provid that the commit type is finit. theorem 4.4. let g = (n, (ai)i∈n, (ui)i∈n) be a game and π an order of it player with which the finit commit type τ associ the tupl xπ1 , . . . , xπn , φ . let further g∗ = n, (xπi )i∈n, (u∗ πi )i∈n , where u∗ πi (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ) = uπi (φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn )), for each τ-commit profil (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). then, a  πcommit profil (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) is a τ-extort in g given π if and onli if there is some benign backward induct f in g∗ given πr with f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). proof. assum that f is a benign backward induct in g∗ rel to πr . then, f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ), for some commit profil (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) of g rel to π. we show by induct that (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) is an extort of order m, for all m with 0 m n. for m = 0, the proof is trivial. for the induct step, consid an arbitrari commit profil (yπ1 , . . . , yπn ) such that (yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) is an extort of order m − 1. in virtu of the induct hypothesi, there is a benign backward induct g of order m − 1 in g∗ with g = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ). as f is also a benign backward induct of order m: (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ πm (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , fπm , . . . , fπ1 ) . henc, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ) ∗ πm (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). by  definit of u∗ πm , then also: φ(yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). we mai conclud that x is an extort of order m. for the onli if direct, assum that x is an extort of g given π. we prove that there is a benign backward induct f (∗) in g∗ for πr with f (∗) = x. in virtu of fact 4.3, there is a benign backward induct h in g∗ given πr . now defin f (∗) in such a wai that f (∗) πi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = xπi , if (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπi−1 ), and f (∗) πi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = hπi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ), otherwis. we prove by induct on m, that f (∗) is a benign backward induct of order m, for each m with 0 m n. the basi is trivial. so assum that f (∗) is a backward induct of order m − 1 in g∗ given πr and consid an arbitrari benign backward induct g of order m − 1 in g∗ given πr . let g be given by (yπn , . . . , yπ1 ). either (yπn , . . . , yπm+1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 ), or thi is not the case. if the latter, it can readili be appreci that: (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , hπm , . . . , hπ1 ) . have assum that h is a benign backward induct,  subsequ, (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , hπm , . . . , hπ1 ) , and (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) . henc, f (∗) is a benign backward induct of order m. in the former case the reason is slightli differ. then, (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ). it follow that: (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (f (∗) πn , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). in virtu of the induct hypothesi, (yπ1 , . . . , yπn ) is an extort of order m − 1 in g given π. as the reason take place under the assumpt that x is an extort in g given π, we also have: φ(yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). then, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 , ) ∗ πm (xπn , . . . , xπ1 )., by  definit of u∗ . we mai conclud that: (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ πm (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) , signifi that f (∗) is a benign backward induct of order m. as an immedi consequ of theorem 4.4 and fact 4.3 we also have the follow result. corollari 4.5. let τ be a finit commit type. then, τ-extort exist for each strateg game and for each order of the player. 4.3 commit order in the case of uncondit commit, it is not alwai  favor to be the first to commit. thi is well illustr by the familiar game rock-paper-scissor. if, on the other hand, the player ar in a posit to make condit commit in thi particular game, move first is an advantag. rather, we find that it can never harm to move first in a two-player game with condit commit. theorem 4.6. let g be a two-player strateg game involv player i. further let f be an extort of g in which i commit first, and g an extort in which i commit second. then, g i f . proof sketch. let f be a condit extort in g given π. it suffic to show that there is some condit extort h of  order 1 in g given π with h = f . assum for a contradict that there is no such extort of order 1 in g given π . then there must be some b∗ ∈ aj such that f ≺j b∗ , a , for all a ∈ ai.  (otherwis we could defin (gj, gi) such that gj = fj(fi), gi(gj) = fi, and for ani other b ∈ aj, gi(b) = a∗ , where a∗ is an action in ai such that (b, a∗ ) j f . then g would be an extort of order 1 in g given π with g .) now consid a condit commit profil h for g and π such that hj(a) = b∗ , for all a ∈ ai. let  further hi be such that (a, hj) i (hi, hj) , for all a ∈ ai. then, h is an extort of order 1 in g given π. observ that (hi, hj) = (fi , b∗ ). henc, f ≺j h , contradict the assumpt that f is an extort in g given π. theorem 4.6 doe not gener to game with more than two player. consid the three-player game in figur 7, with  extens form as in figur 8. here, row and mat have ident  prefer. the latter"s extortion power rel col, howev, ar veri weak if he is to commit first: ani condit commit he make put col in a situat in which she can enforc a  payoff of two, leav mat and row in the cold with a payoff of on. howev, if mat is last to commit and row first, then the latter can exploit hi strateg power, threaten col so that she plai left, and guarante both himself and mat a payoff of two. 4.4 pareto effici anoth issu concern the pareto effici of the strategi  profil extortion through condit commit. we sai that a strategi profil s (weakli) pareto domin anoth strategi  profil t if t i s for all player i and s it for some. moreov, a strategi profil s is (weakli) pareto effici if it is not (weakli) pareto domin by ani other strategi profil. we extend thi terminolog to condit commit profil by sai that a condit commit profil f is (weakli) pareto effici or (weakli) pareto domin anoth condit commit profil if f is or doe so. we now have the follow result. ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (0, 1, 0) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 1, 2) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2,

figur 8: it is not alwai better to commit earli than late, even in the case of condit or induct commit. theorem 4.7. in each game, pareto effici condit  extort exist. moreov, ani strategi profil that pareto domin an extort is also extortion through a condit commit. proof sketch. sinc, in virtu of fact 4.5, extort  gener exist in each game, it suffic to recogn that the second claim hold. let s be the strategi profil (sπ1 , . . . , sπn ). let  further the condit extort f be pareto domin by s. an extort g with g = s can then be construct by adopt all threat of f while promis g . i.e., for all player πi we have gπi (sπ1 , . . . , sπi−1 ) = si and gπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ) = fπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ), for all other tπ1 , . . . , tπn . as s pareto domin f , the threat of f remain effect as threat of g given that s is be promis. thi result hint at a differ between (benign) backward  induct and extort. in gener, solut of benign backward induct can be pareto domin by outcom that ar no benign backward induct solut. therefor, although everi extort can be seen as a benign backward induct in a larger game, it is not the case that all formal properti of extort ar share by benign backward induct in gener. 5. other commit type condit and uncondit commit ar onli two  possibl commit type. the definit also provid for type of commit that allow for commit on commit, thu achiev a finer adjust of promis and threat. similarli, it subsum commit on and to mix strategi. in thi section we comment on some of these possibl. 5.1 induct commit apart from make commit condit on the action of the player to commit later, on could also commit on the  commit of the follow player. inform, such commit would have the form of if you onli dare to commit in such and such a wai, then i do such and such, otherwis i promis to act so and so. for a strateg game g and an order π of the player, we  defin the induct commit of the player induct. the  induct commit avail to π1 coincid with the action that ar avail to him. an induct commit for player πi+1 is a function map each profil of induct commit of  player π1 through πi to on of hi basic action. formal we defin the type of induct commit fπ1 , . . . , fπn , such that for each player πi in a game g and given π: fπ1 =df. aπ1 , fπi+1 =df. a fπ1 ×···×fπi πi+1 . let fπi = fπi fπ1 , . . . , fπi−1 , for each player πi and have f denot the pure strategi profil fπ1 , . . . , fπn . induct commit have a greater extortion power than condit commit. to appreci thi, consid onc more the game in figur 5. we found that the strategi profil in which row choos bottom and col and mat both choos left is not extortion through condit commit. by mean of induct commit, howev, thi is possibl. let f be the induct commit profil such that frow is row choos the bottom row (b), fcol is the column player choos the left column (l) no matter how row decid, and fmat is defin such that: fmat frow, fcol = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ r if frow = t and fcol (b) = r, l otherwis. instead of show formal that f is an induct extort of the strategi profil (b, l, l), we point out inform how thi can be done. we argu that in order to exact a payoff of two by mean of a condit extort, mat would have to lure row into choos the bottom row without at the same time put col in a posit to successfulli threaten row not to choos top. thi, we found, is an imposs if the player can onli make condit  commit. by contrast, if mat can commit to commit, he can undermin col"s effort to threaten row by plai the right  matrix, if col were to do so. yet, mat can still forc row to choos the bottom row, in case col desist form make thi threat. as can readili be observ, in ani game, the induct  commit of the first two player to commit coincid with their condit commit. henc, as an immedi consequ of theorem 4.6, it can never harm to be the first to commit to an induct commit in the two player case. similarli, we find that the game depict in figur 7 also serv as an exampl show that, in case there ar more than two player, it is not  alwai better to commit to an induct commit earli. in thi exampl the strateg posit of mat is so weak if he is to  commit first, that even the possibl to commit induct doe not strengthen it, wherea, in a similar fashion as with condit  commit, row can enforc a payoff of two to both himself and mat if he is the first to commit. 5.2 mix commit type so far we have mere consid commit to and on pure strategi. a natur extens would be also to consid  commit to and on mix strategi. we distinguish between  condit, uncondit as well as induct mix commit. we find that thei ar gener quit incompar with their pure counterpart: in some situat a player can achiev more us a mix commit, in anoth us a pure commit type. a complic factor with mix commit type is that thei 114 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) can result in a mix strategi profil be plai. thi make that the distinct between promis and threat, as delin in section 4.1, get blur for mix commit type. the type of mix uncondit commit associ with each game g and order π of it player the  tupl Σπ1 , . . . , Σπn , id . the two-player case ha been extens studi (e.g., [2, 16]). as a matter of fact, von neumann"s  famou minimax theorem show that for two-player zero-sum game, it doe not matter which player commit first. if the second player to commit plai a mix strategi that ensur hi secur level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14]. in the game of figur 5 we found that, with condit  commit, mat is unabl to enforc an outcom that award him a  payoff of two. recal that the reason of thi failur is that ani effort to deter row from choos the top row is flaw, as it would put col in an excel posit to threaten row not to choos the bottom row. if mat ha induct commit at hi dispos, howev, thi is a possibl. we now find that in case the player can  dispos of uncondit mix strategi, mat is in a much similar posit. he could random uniformli between the left and right matrix. then, row"s expect util is 21 2 if he plai the top row, no matter how col random. the expect payoff of col doe not exce 21 2 , either, in case row choos top. by pure  commit to the left column, col player entic row to plai bottom, as hi expect util then amount to 3. thi ensur an expect util of three for col as well. howev, a player is not alwai better off with uncondit mix commit than with pure condit commit. for an exampl, consid the game in figur 2. us pure condit commit, he can ensur a payoff of three, wherea with  uncondit mix commit 21 2 would be the most he could achiev. neither is it in gener advantag to commit first to a mix strategi in a three-player game. to appreci thi, consid onc more the game in figur 7. again commit to a mix strategi will not achiev much for mat if he is to move first, and as befor the other player have no reason to commit to anyth other than a pure strategi. thi hold for all player if row commit first, col second and mat last, be it that in thi case mat obtain the best payoff he can get. analog to condit and induct commit on can also defin the type of mix condit and mix induct  commit. with the former, a player can condit hi mix  strategi on the mix strategi of the player to commit after him. these tend to be veri larg object and, know littl about them yet, we shelv their formal analysi for futur research.  conceptu, it might not be immedi clear how such mix condit commit can be made with credibl. for on, when on"s commit ar condit on a particular mix strategi be plai, how can it be recogn that it wa in fact thi mix  strategi that wa plai rather than anoth on? if thi prove to be imposs, how can on know how hi condit commit is to be effectu? a possibl answer would be, that all depend on the circumst in which the commit were made. e.g., if the differ agent can submit their mix condit  commit to an independ parti, the latter can execut the  random and determin the uniqu mix strategi profil that their commit induc. 6. summari and conclus in some situat agent can strengthen their strateg posit by commit themselv to a particular cours of action. there ar variou type of commit, e.g., pure, mix and condit. which type of commit an agent is in a posit in to make  essenti depend on the situat under consider. if the agent commit in a particular order, there is a tactic common to make commit of ani type, which we have formal by mean the concept of an extort. thi gener concept of extort can be analyz in abstracto. moreov, on it basi the variou  commit type can be compar formal and systemat. we have seen that the type of commit an agent can make ha a profound impact on what an agent can achiev in a  gamelik situat. in some situat a player is much help if he is in a posit to commit condition, wherea in other mix commit would be more profit. thi rais the question as to the characterist formal featur of the situat in which it is advantag for a player to be abl to make commit of a particular type. anoth issu which we leav for futur research is the  comput complex of find an extort for the differ  commit type. 7. refer [1] a. k. chopra and
