instrument that pai off conting on the  outcom of arbitrari statement in proposit logic. bui or sell secur-which can be thought of as bet on or against a particular futur outcom-allow agent both to hedg risk and to profit (in expect) on subject predict. a compound secur market allow agent to place bet on arbitrari boolean combin of event, enabl them to more close achiev their optim risk  exposur, and enabl the market as a whole to more close achiev the social optimum. the tradeoff for allow such express is in the complex of the agent" and  auction"s optim problem. we develop and motiv the concept of a compound  secur market, present the framework through a seri of formal definit and exampl. we then analyz in  detail the auction"s match problem. we show that, with n event, the match problem is co-np-complet in the divis case and Σp 2-complet in the indivis case. we show that the latter hard result hold even under sever languag restrict on bid. with log n event, the  problem is polynomi in the divis case and np-complet in the indivis case. we briefli discuss match algorithm and tractabl special case. categori and subject descriptor f.2.2 [theori of comput]: analysi of algorithm and problem complex-nonnumer algorithm and problem; j.4 [comput applic]: social and  behavior scienc-econom gener term algorithm, econom, theori. 1. introduct secur market effect allow trader to place bet on the outcom of uncertain futur proposit. exampl includ stock market like nasdaq, option market like cboe [17], futur market like cme [30], other deriv market, insur market, polit stock market [11, 12], sport bet market [7, 13, 32], hors race market [33], idea futur market [16], decis market [14] and even market game [4, 24, 25]. the econom valu of secur market is two-fold. first, thei allow trader to hedg risk, or to insur against undesir outcom. for exampl, the owner of a stock might bui a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insur against a stock downturn. or the owner of a hous mai purchas an insur contract to hedg against unforeseen damag to the hous. second, secur market allow trader to specul, or to obtain a subject expect profit when market price do not reflect their assess of the  likelihood of futur outcom. for exampl, a trader might bui a call option if he believ that the likelihood is high that the price of the underli stock will go up, regardless of risk exposur to chang in the stock price. becaus trader stand to earn a profit if thei can make effect  probabl assess, often price in financi market yield veri accur aggreg forecast of futur event [10, 29, 27, 28]. real secur market have complex payoff structur with variou trigger. howev, these can all be model as collect of more basic or atom arrow-debreu  secur [1, 8, 20]. on unit of on arrow-debreu secur pai off on dollar if and onli if (iff) a correspond binari event occur; it pai noth if the event doe not occur. so, for exampl, on unit of a secur denot acm100 might pai $1 iff acm"s stock is abov $100 on januari 4, 2004. an acm stock option as it would be defin on a  finan144 cial exchang can be though of as a portfolio of such atom secur.1 in thi paper, we develop and analyz a framework for trade in compound secur market with payoff  conting on arbitrari logic combin of event, includ condit. for exampl, given binari event a, b, and c, on trader might bid to bui three unit of a secur  denot a ∧ ¯b ∨ c that pai off $1 iff the compound event a ∧ ¯b ∨ c occur for thirti cent each. anoth trader mai bid to sell six unit of a secur a|c that pai off $1 iff a occur for fifti-five cent each, condit on event c  occur, mean that the transact is revok if c doe not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the  secur is refund) [5]. bid mai also be divis, mean that bidder ar will to accept less than the request quantiti, or indivis, mean that bid must be fulfil either complet or not at all. given a set of such bid, the auction face a complex match problem to decid which bid ar accept for how mani unit at what price. typic, the auction seek to take on no risk of it own, onli match up agreeabl trade among the bidder, but we also consid altern formul where the  auction act as a market maker will to accept some risk. we examin the comput complex of the  auction"s match problem. let the length of the descript of all the avail secur be o(n). with n event, the match problem is co-np-complet in the divis case and Σp 2-complet in the indivis case. thi Σp 2-complet hard hold even when the bid languag is  significantli restrict. with log n event, the problem is  polynomi in the divis case and np-complet in the indivis case. section 2 present some necessari background  inform, motiv, and relat work. section 3 formal  describ our framework for compound secur, and defin the auction"s match problem. section 4 briefli  discuss natur algorithm for solv the match problem. section 5 prove our central comput complex  result. section 6 discuss the possibl of tractabl special case. section 7 conclud with a summari and some idea of futur direct. 2. preliminari 2.1 background and notat imagin a world where there ar onli two futur uncertain event of ani consequ: (1) the event that on"s hous is struck by lightn by decemb 31, 2003, denot struck, and (2) the event that acm"s stock price goe abov $100 by januari 4, 2004, denot acm100. in thi simpl world there ar four possibl futur state-all possibl  combin of the binari event" outcom: struck ∧ acm100, struck ∧ acm100, struck ∧ acm100, struck ∧ acm100. hedg risk can be thought of as an action of move monei between variou possibl futur state. for exampl,  insur1 technic, an option is a portfolio of infinit mani atom secur, though it can be approxim model with a finit number. ing on"s hous transfer monei from futur state where struck is not true to state where it is. sell a secur denot acm100 -that pai off $1 iff the event acm100 occur-transfer monei from futur state where acm"s price is abov $100 on januari 4 to state where it"s not. specul is also an act of transfer monei between futur state, though usual associ with maxim expect return rather than reduc risk. for exampl, bet on a footbal team move monei from the team lose state to the team win state. in practic, agent engag in a mixtur of hedg and specul, and there is no clear divid line between the two [18]. all possibl futur outcom form a state space Ω,  consist of mutual exclus and exhaust state ω ∈ Ω. often a more natur wai to think of possibl futur  outcom is as an event space a of linearli independ event a ∈ a that mai overlap arbitrarili. so in our toi exampl struck ∧ acm100 is on of the four disjoint state, while struck is on of the two event. note that a set of n  linearli independ event defin a state space Ω of size 2n consist of all possibl combin of event outcom. convers, ani state space Ω can be factor into log |Ω| event. suppos that a exhaust cover all meaning futur outcom (i.e., cover all eventu that agent mai wish to hedg against and/or specul upon). then the  exist of 2n linearli independ secur-call a  complet market-allow agent to distribut their wealth  arbitrarili across futur state.2 an agent mai creat ani hedg or specul it desir. under classic condit, agent trade in a complet market form an equilibrium where risk is alloc pareto optim. if the market is incomplet, mean it consist of fewer than 2n linearli independ secur, then in gener agent cannot construct arbitrari hedg and equilibrium alloc mai be nonoptim [1, 8, 19, 20]. in real-world set, the number of meaning event n is larg and thu the number of secur requir for  complet is intract. no truli complet market exist or will ever exist. on motiv behind compound secur market is to provid a mechan that support the most transfer of risk us the least number of transact  possibl. compound secur allow a high degre of express in construct bid. the tradeoff for increas express is increas comput complex, from both the  bidder"s and auction"s point of view. 2.2 relat work the quest to reduc the number of financi instrument requir to support an optim alloc of risk date to arrow"s origin work [1]. the requir state abov of onli 2n linearli-independ secur is itself a reduct from the most straightforward formul. in an economi with k standard good, the most straightforward complet market contain k·2n secur, each pai off in on good under on state realiz. arrow [1] show that a market where secur and good ar essenti separ, with 2n secur pai off in a singl numerair good plu k spot market in the standard good, is also complet. for our purpos, we need consid onli the secur market. 2 by linearli independ secur, we mean that the  vector of payoff in all futur state of these secur ar  linearli independ. 145 varian [34] show that a complet market can be  construct us fewer than 2n secur, replac the  miss secur with option. still, the number of linearli  independ financi instrument-secur plu  optionsmust be 2n to guarante complet. though the requir of 2n financi instrument  cannot be relax if on want to guarante complet in all circumst, pennock and wellman [26] explor  condit under which a smaller secur market mai be  operation complet, mean that it equilibrium is pareto  optim with respect to the agent involv, even if the market contain less than 2n secur. the author show that in some case the market can be structur and compact in analog to bayesian network represent of joint  probabl distribut [23]. thei show that, if all agent" risk-neutral independ agre with the independ encod in the market structur, then the market is  operation complet. for collect of agent all with constant absolut risk avers, agreement on markov independ is suffici. bossaert, fine, and ledyard [2] develop a mechan thei call combin-valu trade (cvt) that allow trader to order an arbitrari portfolio of secur in on bid, rather than break up the order into a sequenc of bid on  individu secur. if the portfolio order is accept, all of the impli trade on individu secur ar execut  simultan, thu elimin so-call execut risk that price will chang in the middl of a plan sequenc of  order. the author conduct laboratori experi show that, even in thin market where ordinari sequenti  trade break down, cvt support effici price and  alloc. note that cvt differ significantli from compound secur trade. cvt allow instantan trade of ani linear combin of secur, while compound secur allow more express secur that can encod nonlinear boolean combin of event. for exampl, cvt mai  allow an agent to order secur a and b in a bundl that pai off as a linear combin of a and b,3 but cvt won"t allow the construct of a compound secur a ∧ b that pai off $1 iff both a and b occur, or a compound secur a|b . relat to cvt ar combinatori auction [6, 21] and  exchang [31], mechan that have recent receiv quit a bit of attent in the econom and comput scienc  literatur. combinatori auction allow bidder to place  distinct valu on all possibl bundl of good rather than just on individu good. in thi wai bidder can express  substitut and complementar relationship among good that cannot be express in standard parallel or sequenti auction. compound secur differ from combinatori auction in concept and complex. compound secur allow bidder to construct an arbitrari bet on ani of the 22n possibl compound event express as logic function of the n base event, condit on ani other of the 22n  compound event. agent optim base on their own  subject probabl and risk attitud (and in gener, their  belief about other agent" belief and util, ad infinitum). the central auction problem is identifi arbitrag  opportun: that is, to match bet togeth without take on ani risk. combinatori auction, on the other hand,  allow bid on ani of the 2n bundl of n good. typic, 3 specif, on unit of each pai off $2 iff both a and b occur, $1 iff a or b occur (but not both), and $0 otherwis. uncertainti-and thu risk-is not consid. the central auction problem is to maxim social welfar. also note that the problem lie in differ complex class. while clear a combinatori auction is polynomi in the  divis case and np-complet in the indivis case, match in a compound secur market is np-complet in the  divis case and Σp 2-complet in the indivis case. in fact, even the problem of decid whether two bid on compound secur match, even in the divis case, is np-complet (see section 5.2). there is a sens in which it is possibl to translat our match problem for compound secur into an  analog problem for clear two-side combinatori exchang [31] of exponenti size. specif, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound secur can be view as bundl of (fraction quantiti of) such good. the materi balanc constraint face the combinatori auction correspond to a restrict that the  compoundsecur auction be disallow from assum ani risk. note that thi translat is not at all us for address the compound-secur match problem, as the result combinatori exchang ha an exponenti number of good. hanson [15] develop a market mechan call a market score rule that is especi well suit for allow bet on a combinatori number of outcom. the mechan maintain a joint probabl distribut over all 2n state, either explicitli or implicitli us a bayesian network or other compact represent. at ani time ani trader who believ the probabl ar wrong can chang ani part of the distribut by accept a lotteri ticket that pai off accord to a score rule (e.g., the logarithm  score rule) [35], as long as that trader also agre to pai off the most recent person to chang the distribut. in the limit of a singl trader, the mechan behav like a  score rule, suitabl for poll a singl agent for it  probabl distribut. in the limit of mani trader, it produc a combin estim. sinc the market essenti alwai ha a complet set of post price for all possibl outcom, the mechan avoid the problem of thin market, or  illiquid, that necessarili plagu ani market contain an exponenti number of altern invest. the  mechan requir a patron to pai off the final person to chang the distribut, though the patron"s payment is bound. though hanson offer some initi suggest, sever open problem remain, includ effici method for  repres and updat the joint distribut and record trader posit and portfolio, without resort to exponenti time and space algorithm. fagin, halpern, and megiddo [9] give a sound and  complet axiomat for decid whether set of  probabilist inequ ar consist. bid for compound secur can be thought of as express of probabilist  inequ: for exampl, a bid to bui a ∧ b at price 0.3 is a statement that the probabl of a ∧ b is greater than 0.3. if a set of singl-unit bid correspond to a set of inconsist probabilist inequ, then there is a match. howev, becaus thei ar interest in a much differ framework, fagin et al. do not consid sever complic factor  specif to the secur market framework: name, handl multi-unit or fraction bid quantiti, identifi match, choos among multipl match, and optim base on probabl and risk attitud. we address these issu  below. 146 3. framework for trade in  compound secur 3.1 high-level descript common knowledg among agent is the set of event a. there ar no predefin secur. instead, agent offer to bui or sell secur of their own design that pai off  conting on logic combin of event and event negat. combin oper mai includ conjunct,  disjunct, and condit. for all practic purpos, it is imposs for agent to trade in enough secur (2n ) to form a complet market, so agent must devis their best tradeoff between the  number and complex of their bid, and the extent to which their risk ar hedg and desir bet ar place. in it most gener form, the problem is game-theoret in natur, sinc what an agent should offer depend on what it believ other agent will accept. at the other end of the spectrum, a simplifi version of the problem is to optim bid onli on current avail secur at current price. in between these two formul ar other possibl interest  optim problem. approxim algorithm might also be pursu. the auction face a nontrivi problem of match bui and sell order to maxim surplu (the cash and secur left over after accept bid ar fulfil). for exampl, offer to sell a1a2 at $0.2 and a1 ¯a2 at $0.1 can match with an offer to bui a1 at $0.4, with surplu $0.1. or an offer to sell a1 at $0.3 can match with an offer to bui a1a2 at $0.4, with surplu $0.1 in cash and a1 ¯a2 in secur. in gener, a singl secur might qualifi for multipl match, but onli on can be transact. so the auction must find the optim set of match that maxim surplu, which could be measur in a number of wai. again,  approxim algorithm might be consid. in anoth  formul, the auction function as a market maker will to take on a certain amount of risk. inform, our motiv is to provid a mechan that allow a veri high degre of express in place hedg and bet, and is also capabl of approxim the optim (complet-market) alloc of risk, trade off the number and complex of secur and transact need. 3.2 formal descript 3.2.1 secur we us φ and ψ to denot arbitrari boolean formula, or logic combin of event in a. we denot secur φ|ψ . secur pai off $1 if and onli if (iff) φ and ψ ar true, pai off $0 iff φ is fals and ψ is true, and ar cancel (i.e., ani price paid is refund) iff ψ is fals. we defin t ≡ Ω to be the event true and f ≡ ∅ to be the event fals. we abbrevi φ|t as φ . 3.2.2 order agent place order, denot o, of the form q unit of φ|ψ at price p per unit, where q > 0 impli a bui order and q < 0 impli a sell order. we assum agent submit bui (sell) order will accept ani price p∗ ≤ p (p∗ ≥ p). we distinguish between divis and indivis order. agent submit divis order will accept ani quantiti αq where 0 < α ≤ 1. agent submit  indivis order will accept onli exactli q unit, or none at all. we believ that, given the natur of what is be trade (state-conting dollar), most agent will be content to trade us divis order. everi order o can be translat into a payoff vector Υ across all state ω ∈ Ω. the payoff Υ ω in state ω is q · 1ω∈ψ(1ω∈φ − p), where 1ω∈e equal 1 iff ω ∈ e and zero otherwis. recal that the 2n state correspond to the 2n possibl combin of event outcom. we index multipl order with subscript (e.g., oi and Υi). let the set of all order be o and the set of all correspond payoff vector be p. exampl 1. (translat order into payoff vector)  suppos that |a| = 3. consid an order to bui two unit of a2 ∨ a3|a1 at price $0.8. the correspond payoff vector is: Υ = Υ a1a2a3 , Υ a1a2 ¯a3 , Υ a1 ¯a2a3 , . . . , Υ ¯a1 ¯a2 ¯a3 = 2 · 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, −0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0 2 3.2.3 the match problem the auction"s task, call the match problem, is to determin which order to accept among all order o ∈ o. let αi be the fraction of order oi accept by the auction (in the indivis case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the divis case, αi can rang from 0 to 1). if αi = 0, then order oi is consid reject and no transact take place concern thi order. for accept order (αi > 0), the auction receiv the monei lost by bidder and pai out the monei won by bidder, so the auction"s payoff vector is: Υauc = x Υi∈p −αiΥi. we also call the auction"s payoff vector the surplu vector, sinc it is the (possibl state-conting) monei left over after all accept order ar fill. assum that the auction want to choos a set of order so that it is guarante not to lose ani monei in ani futur state, but that the auction doe not necessarili insist on obtain a posit benefit from the transact (i.e., the auction is content to break even). definit 1. (match problem, indivis case) given a set of order o, doe there exist αi ∈ {0, 1} with at least on αi = 1 such that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0? in other word, doe there exist a nonempti subset of order that the auction can accept without risk? 2 if ∀ω, Υ ω auc = c where c is nonneg, then the surplu leftov after process thi match is c dollar. let m = minω[Υ ω auc]. in gener, process a match leav m dollar in cash and Υ ω auc − m in state-conting dollar, which can then be translat into secur. exampl 2. (indivis order match) suppos |a| = 2. consid an order to bui on unit of a1a2 at price 0.4 and an order to sell on unit of a1 at price 0.3. the 147 correspond payoff vector ar: Υ1 = Υ a1a2 1 ,Υ a1 ¯a2 1 ,Υ ¯a1a2 1 ,Υ ¯a1 ¯a2 1 = 0.6, −0.4, −0.4, −0.4 Υ2 = −0.7, −0.7, 0.3, 0.3 the auction"s payoff vector (the neg of the  componentwis sum of the abov two vector) is: Υauc = −Υ1 − Υ2 = 0.1, 1.1, 0.1, 0.1 . sinc all compon ar nonneg, the two order match. the auction can process both order, leav a surplu of $0.1 in cash and on unit of a1 ¯a2 in secur. 2 now consid the divis case, where order can be  partial fill. definit 2. (match problem, divis case) given a set of order o, doe there exist αi ∈ [0, 1] with at least on αi > 0 such that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0, 2 exampl 3. (divis order match) suppos |a| = 2. consid an order to sell on unit of a1 at price $0.5, an order to bui on unit of a1a2|a1 ∨ a2 at price $0.5, and an order to bui on unit of a1| ¯a2 at price $0.4. the correspond payoff vector ar: Υ1 = Υ a1a2 1 ,Υ a1 ¯a2 1 ,Υ ¯a1a2 1 ,Υ ¯a1 ¯a2 1 = −0.5, −0.5, 0.5, 0.5 Υ2 = 0.5, −0.5, −0.5, 0 Υ3 = 0, 0.6, 0, −0.4 it is clear by inspect that no non-empti subset of whole order constitut a match: in all case where αi ∈ {0, 1} (other than all αi = 0), at least on state sum to a posit amount (neg for the auction). howev, if α1 = α2 = 3/5 and α3 = 1, then the auction"s payoff vector is: Υauc = − 3 5 Υ1 − 3 5 Υ2 − Υ3 = 0, 0, 0, 0.1 , constitut a match. the auction can process 3/5 of the first and second order, and all of the third order, leav a surplu of 0.1 unit of ¯a1 ¯a2 . in thi exampl, a divis match exist even though an indivis match is not possibl; we examin the distinct in detail in section 5, where we separ the two match problem into distinct complex class. 2 the match problem defin abov ar decis  problem: the task is onli to show the exist or nonexist of a match. howev, there mai be multipl match from which the auction can choos. sometim the choic ar equival from the auction"s perspect; altern, an object function can be us to find an optim match accord to that object. exampl 4. (auction altern i) suppos |a| = 2. consid an order to sell on unit of a1 at price $0.7, an order to sell on unit of a2 at price $0.7, an order to bui on unit of a1a2 at price $0.4, an order to bui on unit of a1 ¯a2 at price $0.4, and an order to bui on unit of ¯a1a2 at price $0.4. the correspond payoff vector ar: Υ1 = −0.3,−0.3, 0.7, 0.7 Υ2 = −0.3, 0.7,−0.3, 0.7 Υ3 = 0.6,−0.4,−0.4,−0.4 Υ4 = −0.4, 0.6,−0.4,−0.4 Υ5 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6,−0.4 consid the indivis case. the auction could choos to accept bid 1, 3, and 4 togeth, or the auction could choos to accept bid 2, 3, and 5 togeth. both constitut match, and in fact both yield ident payoff (Υauc = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 , or $0.1 in cash) for the auction. 2 exampl 5. (auction altern ii) suppos |a| = 2. consid an order to sell two unit of a1 at price $0.6, an order to bui on unit of a1a2 at price $0.3, and an order to bui on unit of a1 ¯a2 at price $0.5. the  correspond payoff vector ar: Υ1 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6, 0.6 Υ2 = 0.7,−0.3,−0.3,−0.3 Υ3 = −0.5, 0.5,−0.5,−0.5 consid the divis case. the auction could choos to accept on unit each of all three bid, yield a payoff to the auction of $0.2 in cash (Υauc = 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 ). altern, the auction could choos to accept 4/3 unit of bid 1, and on unit each of bid 2 and 3, yield a payoff to the auction of 1/3 unit of secur a1 . both choic constitut match (in fact, accept ani number of unit of bid 1 between 1 and 4/3 can be part of a match), though depend on the auction"s object, on choic might be prefer over anoth. for exampl, if the auction believ that a1 is veri like to occur, it mai prefer to accept 4/3 unit of bid 1. 2 there ar mani possibl criteria for the auction to  decid among match, all of which seem reason in some circumst. on natur quantiti to maxim is the volum of trade among bidder; anoth is the auction"s util, either with or without the arbitrag constraint. definit 3. (trade maxim problem) given a set of indivis (divis) order o, choos αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maxim x i αiqi, under the constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. 2 anoth reason variat is to maxim the total  percent of order fill, or p i αi, under the same (risk-free) constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. definit 4. (auction risk-free util-maxim problem) let the auction"s subject probabl for each state ω be pr(ω), and let the auction"s util for y  dollar be u(y). given a set of indivis (divis) order o, choos αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maxim x ω∈Ω pr(ω)u(Υ ω auc), 148 under the constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. 2 definit 5. (auction standard util-maxim problem) let the auction"s subject probabl for each state ω be pr(ω), and let the auction"s util for y  dollar be u(y). given a set of indivis (divis) order o, choos αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maxim x ω∈Ω pr(ω)u  Υ ω auc  . 2 thi last object function drop the risk-free (arbitrag) constraint. in thi case, the auction is a market maker with belief about the likelihood of outcom, and the  auction mai actual lose monei is some outcom. still other variat and other optim criteria seem reason, includ social welfar, etc. it also seem  reason to suppos that the surplu be share among bidder and the auction, rather than retain sole by the  auction. thi is analog to choos a common transact price in a doubl auction (e.g., the midpoint between the bid and ask price), rather than the buyer pai the bid price and the seller receiv the ask price, with the differ go to the auction. the problem becom more  complic when divid surplu secur, in part becaus thei ar valu differ by differ agent. formul reason share rule and examin the result  incent properti seem a rich and promis avenu for further investig. 4. match algorithm the straightforward algorithm for solv the divis match problem is linear program; we set up an  appropri linear program in section 5.1. the straightforward algorithm for solv the indivis match problem is  integ program. with n event, to set up the  appropri linear or integ program, simpli write out the payoff vector in the straightforward wai requir o(2n ) space. there is some hope that special algorithm that  exploit structur among bid can perform better in term of averag-case time and space complex. for exampl, in some case match can be identifi us logic reduct techniqu, without write down the full payoff vector. so a match between the follow bid: • sell 1 of a1a2 at $0.2 • sell 1 of a1 ¯a2 at $0.1 • bui 1 of a1 at $0.4 can be identifi by reduc the first two bid to an  equival offer to sell a1 at $0.3 that clearli match with the third bid. formal a logic-reduct algorithm for match, or other algorithm that can exploit special  structur among the bid, is a promis avenu for futur work. 5. the comput complex of match in thi section we examin the comput complex of the auction"s match problem. here n refer to the problem"s input size that includ descript of all of the bui and sell order. we also assum that n bound the number of base secur. we consid four case base on two paramet: 1. whether to allow divis or indivis order. 2. the number of secur. we consid two  possibl: (a) o(log n) base secur yield a polynomi  number of state. (b) an unlimit number of base secur yield an exponenti number of state. we show the follow result. theorem 1. the match problem is 1. comput in polynomi-time for o(log n) base  secur with divis order. 2. co-np-complet for unlimit secur with divis order. 3. np-complet for o(log n) base secur with  indivis order. 4. Σp 2-complet for unlimit secur with indivis order. 5.1 small number of secur with divis order we can build a linear program base on definit 2. we have variabl αi. for each i, we have 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1 and for each state ω in Ω we have the constraint Υ ω auc = x i −αiΥ ω i ≥ 0. given these constraint we maxim x i αi. a set of order ha a match exactli when p i αi > 0. with o(log n) base secur, we have |Ω| bound by a polynomi so we can solv thi linear program in polynomi time. note that on might argu that on should maxim some linear combin of the −Υ ω i s to maxim the surplu. howev thi approach will not find match that have zero surplu. 5.2 larg number of secur with divis order with unlimit base secur, the linear program given in section 5.1 ha an exponenti number of constraint  equat. each constraint is short to describ and easili  comput given ω. 149 let m ≤ n be the total number of bui and sell order. by the theori of linear program, an upper bound on the object function can be forc by a collect of m + 1 constraint. so if no match exist there must exist m + 1 constraint that forc all the αi to zero. in nondeterminist polynomi-time we can guess these constraint and solv the reduc linear program. thi show that match is in co-np. to show co-np-complet we reduc the np-complet problem of boolean formula satisfi to the nonexist of a match. fix a formula φ. let the base secur be the variabl of φ and consid the singl secur φ with a bui order of 0.5. if the formula φ is satisfi then there is some state with payoff 0.5 and no fraction unit of the secur φ is a match. if the formula φ is not satisfi then everi state ha an auction"s payoff of 0.5 and a singl unit of the secur φ is a match. on could argu that if the formula φ is not satisfi then no fulli ration buyer would want to bui φ for a cost of 0.5. we can get around thi problem by ad auxiliari base secur, a and b, and defin two secur τ = (φ ∧ a) ∨ (a ∧ b) τ = (φ ∧ a) ∨ (a ∧ b) with separ bui order of 0.5 on each. if φ were satisfi then in the state correspond to the satisfi assign and both a and b to be true, τ and τ both have an auction"s payoff of −0.5 so even no divis match can exist. if φ were not satisfi then on unit of each would be a match sinc in everi state at least on of τ or τ ar fals. 5.3 small number of secur with indivis order thi case is easili seen to be in np: just  nondeterminist guess a nonempti subset s of order and check for each state ω in Ω that Υ ω auc = x i∈s −Υ ω i ≥ 0. sinc |Ω| and |s| ar bound by a polynomi in n, the verif can be done in polynomi time. to show that match is np-complet we reduc the  npcomplet problem exact cover by 3-set (x3c) to a match of secur. the input to x3c consist of a set x and a collect c of 3-element subset of x. the input (x, c) is in x3c if c contain an exact cover of x, i.e., there is a subcollect c of c such that everi element of x occur in exactli on member of c . karp show that x3c is np-complet. suppos we have an instanc (x, c) with the vector x = {x1, . . . , x3q} and c = {c1, . . . , cm}. we set Ω = {e1, . . . , e3q, r, s} and defin secur label φ1 , . . . , φm , ψ1 , . . . , ψq and τ , as follow: • secur φi is true in state r, and is true in state ek if k is not in ci. • secur ψj is true onli in state s. • secur τ is true in each state ek but not r or s. we have bui order on each φi and ψj secur for 0.5 − 1 8q and a bui order on τ for 0.5. we claim that a match exist if and onli if (x, c) is in x3c. if (x, c) is in x3c, let c be the subcollect that cover each element of x exactli onc. note that |c | = q. we claim the collect consist of φi for each ci in c , everi ψj and τ ha a match. in each state ek we have an auction"s payoff of (.5 − 1 8q ) + (q − 1)(−.5 − 1 8q ) + q(.5 − 1 8q ) − .5 = .5 − 2q 1 8q = .25 ≥ 0. in state r and s the auction"s payoff ar −q(.5 + 1 8q ) + −q(−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 = −5 − 2q 1 8q = .25 ≥ 0. suppos now that (x, c) is not in x3c but there is a match. consid the number q of the φi in that  match and q the number of ψj in the match. sinc a match requir a nonempti subset of the order and τ by itself is not a match we have q + q > 0. we have three case. q > q: in state r, the auction"s payoff is −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q(−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 ≤ −(q + q) 1 8q < 0. q > q : in state s, the auction"s payoff is −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q (−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 ≤ −(q + q ) 1 8q < 0. q ≤ q ≤ q: consid the set c consist of the ci where φi is in the match. there must be some state ek not in ani of the ci or c would be an exact cover. the auction"s payoff in ek is at most −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q (−.5 + 1 8q ) ≤ −(q + q ) 1 8q < 0. 5.4 larg number of secur with  indivis order the class Σp 2 is the second level of the polynomi-time hierarchi. a languag l is in Σp 2 if there exist a polynomi p and a set a in p such that x is in l if and onli if there is a y with |y| = p(|x|) such that for all z, with |z| = p(|x|), (x, y, z) is in a. the class Σp 2 contain both np and  conp. unless the polynomi-time hierarchi collaps (which is consid unlik), a problem that is complet for Σp 2 is not contain in np or co-np. we will show that comput a match is Σp 2-complet, and remain so even for quit restrict type of secur, and henc is (like) neither in np or co-np. while it mai seem that be np-complet or co-np-complet is hard enough, there ar further practic consequ of be outsid of np and co-np. if the match problem were in np, on could us heurist to search for and verifi a match if it exist; even if such heurist fail in the worst case, thei mai succe for most exampl in practic. similarli, if the match problem were in co-np, on might hope to at least heurist rule out the possibl of match. but for problem outsid of np or co-np, there is no framework for verifi that a heurist deriv answer is correct. less formal, for np (or co-np)-complet problem, you have to be lucki; for Σp 2-complet problem, you can"t even tell if you"ve been lucki. 150 we note that the exist of a match is in Σp 2: we us y to choos a subset of the order and z to repres a state ω with (x, y, z) in a if the set of order ha a total nonposit auction"s payoff in state ω. we prove a stronger theorem which impli that match is in Σp 2. let s1, . . . , sn be a set of secur, where each secur si ha cost ci and pai off pi whenev formula ci is satisfi. the 0 − 1-match problem ask whether on can, by accept either 0 or 1 of each secur, guarante a worst-case payoff strictli larger than the total cost. theorem 2. the 0−1-match problem is Σp 2-complet. furthermor, the problem remain Σp 2-complet under the follow two special case: 1. for all i, ci is a conjunct of 3 base event (or their negat), pi = 1, and ci = cj for all i and j. 2. for all i, ci is a conjunct of at most 2 base  secur (or their negat). these hard result hold even if there is a promis that no subset of the secur guarante a worst-case payoff ident to their cost. to prove theorem 2, we reduc from the standard Σp 2 problem that we call t∃∀bf. given a boolean formula φ with variabl x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn is the follow  fullyquantifi formula true ∃x1 . . . ∃xn∀y1 . . . ∀yn φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn)? the problem remain Σp 2-complet when φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn) is restrict to be a disjunct of conjunct of at most 3 variabl (or their negat), e.g., φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn) = (x1 ∧ ¯x3 ∧ y2) ∨ (x2 ∧ y3 ∧ y7) ∨ · · · . thi form, without the bound on the conjunct size, is known as disjunct normal form (dnf); the restrict to conjunct of 3 variabl is 3-dnf. we reduc t∃∀bf to find a match. for the simplest reduct, we consid the match problem where on ha a set of arrow-debreu secur whose payoff event ar conjunct of the base secur, or their negat. the auction ha the option of accept either 0 or 1 of each of the given secur. we first reduc to the case where the payoff event ar conjunct of arbitrarili mani base event (or their  negat). by a standard trick we can reduc the number of base event in each conjunct to 3, and with a slight twist we can even ensur that all secur have the same price as well as the same payoff. final, we show that the problem remain hard even if onli conjunct of 2 variabl ar allow, though with secur that deviat slightli from arrow-debreu secur in that thei mai have vari, non unit payoff. 5.4.1 the basic reduct befor describ the secur, we give some intuit. the t∃∀bfproblem mai be view as a game between a selector and an adversari. the selector set the xi variabl, and then the adversari set the yi variabl so as to falsifi the formula φ. we can view the 0 − 1-match problem as on in which the auction is a buyer who bui secur correspond to disjunct of the base event, and then the adversari set the valu of the base event to minim the payoff from the secur. we construct our secur so that the optim bui strategi is to bui n expens secur along with a set of cheap secur, of neglig cost (for some case we can modifi the construct so that all secur have the same cost). the total cost of the secur will be just under 1, and each secur pai off 1, so the adversari must ensur that none of the secur pai off. each expens secur forc the adversari to set some variabl, xi to a particular valu to prevent the secur from pai off; thi correspond to set the xi variabl in the origin game. the cheap secur ar such that prevent everi on of of these secur from pai off is equival to falsifi φ in the origin game. among the technic difficulti we face is how to prevent the buyer from bui conflict secur, e.g., on that forc xi = 0 and the other that forc xi = 1, allow for a trivial arbitrag. secondli, for our analysi we need to ensur that a trader cannot spend more to get more, sai by spend 1.5 for a set of secur with the properti that at least 2 secur pai off under all possibl event. for each of the variabl {xi}, {yi} in φ, we add a  correspond base secur (with the same label). for each existenti variabl xi we add addit base secur, ni and zi. we also includ a base secur q. in our basic construct, each expens secur cost c and each cheap secur cost ; all secur pai off 1. we requir that cn+ (|cheap secur|) < 1 and c(n+1) > 1. that is, on can bui n expens secur and all of the cheap secur for less than 1, but on cannot bui n + 1 expens secur for less than 1. we at time refer to a secur by it payoff claus. remark: we mai loos think of as 0. howev, thi would allow on to bui a secur for noth that pai (in the worst case) noth. by make > 0 , we can show it hard to distinguish portfolio that guarante a posit profit from those that risk a posit loss. set > 0 will also allow us to show hard result for the case where all secur have the same cost. for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have two expens secur with payoff claus (¯xi ∧q) and (¯ni ∧q) and two cheap secur with payoff claus (xi ∧ ¯zi) and (ni ∧ ¯zi). for each claus c ∈ φ, we convert everi negat variabl ¯xi into ni and add the conjunct z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn. thu, for a claus c = (x2 ∧ ¯x7 ∧ ¯y5) we construct a cheap secur sc, with payoff claus (z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn ∧ x2 ∧ n7 ∧ ¯y5). final, we have a cheap secur with payoff claus ( ¯q). we now argu that a match exist iff ∃x1 . . . ∃xn∀y1 . . . ∀yn φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn). we do thi by success constrain the buyer and the adversari, elimin behavior that would caus the other player to win. the result reason strategi  correspond exactli to the game version of t∃∀bf. first, observ that if the adversari set all of the base secur to fals (0), then onli the ( ¯q) secur will pai off. 151 thu, no buyer can bui more than n expens secur and guarante a profit. the problem is thu whether on can bui n expens secur and all the cheap secur, so that at for ani set of the base event at least on secur will pai off. clearli, the adversari must make q hold, or the ( ¯q)  secur will pai off. next, we claim that for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ i, the auction must bui at least on of the (¯xi ∧ q) and (¯ni ∧ q) secur. thi follow from the fact that if the  adversari set xi, ni and zi to be fals, and everi other base event to be true, then onli the (¯xi ∧ q) and (¯ni ∧ q)  secur will pai off. as no auction can bui more than n expens secur, it must therefor bui exactli on of (¯xi ∧ q) or (¯ni ∧ q), for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. for the rest of the analysi, we assum that the auction follow thi constraint. suppos that the buyer bui (¯xi ∧q). then the adversari must set xi to be true (sinc it must set q to be true), or the secur will pai off. it must then set zi to be true or (xi∧¯zi) will pai off. sinc the buyer doesn"t bui (¯ni ∧ q) (by the abov constraint), and all the other secur pai the same or less when ni is made fals, we can assum without loss of gener that the adversari set ni to be fals. similarli, if the buyer bui (¯ni ∧ q), then the adversari must set ni and zi to be true, and we can assum without loss of gener that the adversari set xi to be fals. note that the adversari must in all case set each zi event to be true. summar the preced argument, there is an exact correspond between the ration strategi of the buyer and set for the xi variabl forc on the adversari. furthermor, the adversari is also constrain to set the variabl q, z1, . . . , zn to be true, and without loss of  gener mai be assum to set ni = ¯xi. under these  constraint, those secur not correspond to claus in φ ar guarante to not pai off. the adversari also decid the valu of the y1, . . . , ym base event. recal that for each claus c ∈ φ there is a correspond secur sc. given that zi is true and ni = ¯xi (without loss of gener), it follow from the construct of sc that the set of the yi caus sc to pai off iff it satisfi c. thi establish the reduct from t∃∀bf to the match problem, when the secur ar constrain to be a conjunct of polynomi mani base event or their negat. 5.4.2 reduc to 3-variabl conjunct there ar standard method for reduc dnf formula to 3-dnf formula, which ar trivial modifi to our  secur framework; we includ the reduct for complet. given a secur s whose payoff claus is c = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ · · · ∧ vk) (variabl negat ar irrelev to thi discuss), cost c and payoff p, introduc a new auxiliari variabl, w, and replac the secur with two secur, s1 and s2, with payoff claus, c1 = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ w) and c2 = ( ¯w ∧ v3 ∧ · · · ∧ vk). the secur both have payoff p, and their cost can be ani posit valu that sum to c. note that at most on of the secur can pai off at a time. if onli on secur is bought, then the adversari can alwai set w so that it won"t pai off; henc the auction will bui either both or neither, for a total cost of c (here we us the fact that on is onli allow to bui either 0 or 1 share of each secur). then, it mai be verifi that, given the abil to set w arbitrarili, the adversari can caus c to be unsatisfi iff it can caus both c1 and c2 to be unsatisfi. henc, own on share each of s1 and s2 is equival to own on share of s. note that c1 ha three variabl and c2 ha k−1 variabl. by appli the transform success, on obtain an equival set of secur, of polynomi size, whose payoff claus have at most 3 variabl. we note that in the basic construct, all of the claus with more than 3 variabl ar associ with cheap  secur (cost ). instead of subdivid cost, we can simpli make all of the result secur have cost ; the  constraint on c and must reflect the new, larger number of cheap secur. on can ensur that all of the payoff claus have exactli 3 variabl, with a similar construct. a secur s with cost c, payoff p and defin claus (x ∧ y) can be replac by secur s1 and s2 with cost c/2, payoff p and defin claus (x∧y∧w) and (x∧y∧ ¯w), where w is a new auxiliari variabl. essenti the same analysi as given abov  appli to thi case. the case of singl-variabl payoff claus is handl by two applic of thi techniqu. 5.4.3 reduc to equi-cost secur by set c and appropri, on can ensur that in the basic reduct everi secur cost a polynomi bound integ multipl of ; call thi ratio r. we now show how to reduc thi case to the case where everi  secur cost . recal that the expens secur have payoff claus (¯xi ∧ q) or (¯ni ∧ q). assum that  secur s ha payoff claus (¯xi ∧ q) (the other case is handl ident). replac s with secur s , with payoff claus (¯xi ∧ q ∧ w1) (w1, . . . , wr−1 ar auxiliari variabl; fresh variabl ar chosen for each claus), and also s1, . . . , sr−1, with payoff claus ( ¯w1 ∧ w2), ( ¯w2 ∧ w3), . . . , ( ¯wr−2 ∧ wr−1), and( ¯wr−1 ∧ ¯w1). clearli, bui none of the new secur is equival to not bui the origin secur. we show that bui all of the new secur is equival to bui the origin secur, and that bui a proper, nonempti subset of the secur is irrat. we first note that if the buyer bui secur s1, . . . , sr−1, then the adversari must set w1 to be true, or on of the secur will pai off. to see thi, note that if wi is set to fals, then ( ¯wi ∧wi+1) will be true unless wi+1 is set to fals; thu, set w1 to fals forc the adversari to set wr−1 to fals, caus the final claus to be true. have set w1 true, the adversari can set w2, . . . , wr−1 to fals, ensur that none of the secur s1, . . . , sr−1 pai out. if wi is true, then (¯xi ∧ q ∧ w1) is equival to (¯xi ∧ q). so bui all of the replac secur for each is equival to bui the origin secur for r. it remain to show that bui a proper, nonempti  subset of the secur is irrat. if on doesn"t bui s , then the adversari can set the w variabl so that none of s1, . . . , sr−1 will pai off; ani monei spent on these  secur is wast. if on doesn"t bui sr−1, the adversari can set all w to fals, in which case none of the new claus will pai off, regardless of the valu of xi and q. similarli, if on 152 doesn"t bui si, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r −2, the adversari can set wi+1 to be true, all the other w variabl to be fals, and again there is no payoff, regardless of the valu of xi and q. thu, bui a proper subset of these secur will not increas on payoff. we note that thi reduct can be combin trivial with the reduct that ensur that all of the defin claus have 3 or fewer variabl. with a slightli messier argument, all of the defin claus can be set up to have exactli 3 variabl. 5.4.4 reduc to claus of at most 2 variabl if we allow secur to have variabl payoff and price, we can reduc to the case where each secur"s payoff claus is a conjunct of at most 2 variabl or their negat. given a secur s with payoff claus (x ∧ y ∧ z), cost c and payoff 1, we introduc fresh auxiliari variabl, w1, w2 and w3 (new variabl ar us for each claus) and replac s with the follow secur: • secur s1, s2 and s3, each with cost c/3 and payoff 1, with respect payoff claus (x ∧ w1), (y ∧ w2) and (z ∧ w3). • secur s1, . . . , s6, each with cost 4 and payoff 24 − 2, with payoff claus, (w1 ∧ w2) (w1 ∧ w3) (w2 ∧ w3) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w2) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w3) ( ¯w2 ∧ ¯w3) here, 2 is a tini posit quantiti, describ later. by a simpl case analysi, we have the follow. observ: 1. for ani i, there exist a set of w1, w2 an w3 such that of the s secur onli si pai off. 2. for ani set of w1, w2 and w3, at least on of the s secur will pai off. 3. if w1, w2 and w3 ar all fals, all of the s secur will pai off. 4. set on of w1, w2 or w3 to be true, and the other to be 0, will caus exactli on of the s secur to pai off. by observ 1, there is no point in bui a nonempti proper subset of the s secur: the adversari can ensur that none of the bought secur will pai off, and even if all the s secur pai off, it will not be suffici to recoup the cost of bui a singl s secur. by observ 2, if on bui all the s secur, on is guarante to almost make back on invest (except for 2), in which case by observ 3 and 4, the adversari optim strategi is to make exactli on of w1, w2 or w3 true. we set c, and 2 so that cn + (|cheap secur|) + 2(|claus|) < 1. thu, the accumul loss of 2 can never spell the  differ between make a guarante profit and make no profit at all. note also that by make 2 posit we prevent the exist of break-even bui strategi in which the buyer onli purchas s secur. summar the previou argument, we mai assum  without loss of gener that the buyer bui all of the s  secur (for all claus), and that for each claus the adversari set exactli on of that claus"s auxiliari variabl w1, w2 or w3 to be true. for the rest of the discuss, we assum that the player follow these constraint. we next claim that a ration buyer will either bui all of s1, s2 or s3, or none of them. if the buyer doesn"t bui s1, then if the adversari make w1 true and w2 and w3 fals, neither s2 nor s3 will pai off, regardless of how the adversari set x, y and z. henc, there is no point in bui either s2 or s3 if on doesn"t bui s1. appli the same argument to s2 and s3 establish the claim. clearli, bui none of s1, s2 and s3 ha, up to neglig 2 factor, the same price/payoff behavior as not bui s. we next argu that, subject to the establish constraint put on the player" behavior, bui all of s1, s2 and s3 ha the same price/payoff behavior (again ignor 2 factor) as bui s, regardless of how the adversari set x, y and z. first, in both case, the cost is c. if the adversari make x, y and z true, then s pai off 1, and (assum that exactli on of w1, w2 and w3 is true), exactli on of s1, s2 or s3 will pai off 1. if x is fals, then s doesn"t pai off, and the adversari can set w1 true (and w2 and w3 fals), ensur that none of s1, s2 and s3 pai off. the same argument hold if y or z ar fals. 6. tractabl case the logic question to ask in light of these complex  result is whether further, more sever restrict on the space of secur can enabl tractabl match algorithm.  although we have not systemat explor the possibl, the potenti for us tractabl case certainli exist. suppos, for exampl, that bid ar limit to unit  quantiti of secur of the follow two form: 1. disjunct of posit event: a1 ∨ · · · ∨ ak . 2. singl neg event: ¯ai . let p be the price offer for a disjunct a1 ∨ · · · ∨ ak , and qi the maxim price offer for the respect negat disjunct. thi disjunct bid is part of a match iff p +p i qi ≥ k. evalu whether thi condit is satisfi by a subset of bid is quit straightforward. although thi exampl is contriv, it applic is not entir implaus. for exampl, the disjunct mai  correspond to insur custom, who want an insur  contract to cover all the potenti caus of their asset loss. the atom secur ar sold by insur, each of whom  special in a differ form of disast caus. 7. conclus and futur direct we have analyz the comput complex of  match for secur base on logic formula. mani possibl avenu for futur work exist, includ 1. analyz the agent" optim problem: • how to choos quantiti and bid/ask price for a collect of secur to maxim on"s  expect util, both for linear and nonlinear util function. 153 • how to choos secur; that is, decid on what collect of boolean formula to offer to trade, subject to constraint or penalti on the number or complex of bid. • how do make the abov choic in a game  theoret sound wai, take into account the choic of other trader, their reason about other trader, etc. 2. although match is like intract, ar there good heurist that achiev match in mani case or  approxim a match? 3. explor share rule for divid the surplu, and incent properti of the result mechan. 4. we mai consid a market to be in comput  equilibrium if no computation-bound player can find a strategi that increas util. with few except [3, 22], littl is known about comput  equilibrium. a natur question is to determin whether a market can achiev a comput equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumst thi mai occur. acknowledg we thank rahul sami for hi help with section 5.4.4. we thank rahul, joan feigenbaum and robin hanson for
