or in other word: what doe it mean for a design of an einstitut to state a set of norm? we advanc a precis thesi on thi issu, which is also inspir by work in social theori: now, as the origin manner of produc physic  entiti is creation, there is hardli a better wai to  describ the product of moral entiti than by the word ‘imposit" [impositio]. for moral entiti do not aris from the intrins substanti principl of thing but ar superad to thing alreadi exist and  physic complet ([21], pp. 100-101). by ignor for a second the philosoph jargon of the  seventeenth centuri we can easili extract an illumin messag from the excerpt: what institut do is to impos properti on alreadi exist entiti. that is to sai, institut provid descript of entiti by make us of conceptu that ar not proper of the common descript of those entiti. for exampl, that car have wheel is a common factual properti, wherea the fact that car count as vehicl in some technic legal sens is a properti that law impos on the concept car. to sai it with [25], the fact that car have wheel is a brute fact, while the fact that car ar vehicl is an institut fact. institut build structur  descript of institut properti upon brute descript of a given domain. at thi point, the step toward einstitut is natur.  einstitut impos properti on the possibl state of a ma: thei  specifi what ar the state in which an agent i enact a role r; what ar the state in which a certain agent is violat the norm of the  institut, etc. thei do thi via link some institut properti of the possibl state and transit of the system (e.g., agent i  enact role r) to some brute properti of those state and transit (e.g., agent i perform protocol no.56). an institut properti is therefor a properti of system state or system transit (i.e., a state type or a transit type) that doe not belong to a mere technic, or factual, descript of the system. to sum up, institut ar view as set of norm (norm system perspect), and norm ar thought of as the imposit of an institut descript of the system upon it descript in term of brute properti. in a nutshel, institut ar imposit of institut terminolog upon brute on. the follow  section provid a formal analysi of thi thesi and show it  explanatori power in deliv a rigor understand of kei featur of institut. becaus of it suitabl for repres complex domain descript, the formal framework we will make us of is the on of descript logic (dl). the us of such formal will also stress the idea of view institut as the imposit of domain descript. 2.1 preliminari: a veri express dl the descript logic languag enabl the necessari  express expand the standard descript logic languag alc ([3]) with relat oper ( ,◦,¬,id) to express complex transit type, and relat hierarchi (h) to express inclus between transit type. follow a notat convent common within dl we denot thi languag with alch( ,◦,¬,id) . definit 1. (syntax of alch( ,◦,¬,id) ) transit type and state type construct ar defin by the  follow bnf: α := a | α ◦ α | α α | ¬α | id(γ) γ := c | ⊥ | ¬γ | γ γ | ∀α.γ where a and c ar atom transit type and, respect, atom state type. it is worth provid the intuit read of a coupl of the  oper and the construct just introduc. in particular ∀α.γ ha to be read as: after all execut of transit of type α, state of type γ ar reach. the oper ◦ denot the concaten of transit type. the oper id appli to a state descript γ and yield a transit descript, name, the transit end in γ state. it is the descript logic variant of the test oper in dynam logic ([5]). notic that we us the same symbol and ¬ for denot the boolean oper of disjunct and negat of both state and transit type. atom state type c ar often index by an agent identifi i in order to express agent properti (e.g., dutch(i)), and atom transit type a ar often index by a pair of agent identifi (i, j) (e.g., pai(i, j)) denot the  actor and, respect, the recipi of the transit. by remov the agent identifi from state type and transit type we  obtain state type form (e.g., dutch or rea(r)) and transit type form (e.g., pai). a terminolog box (henceforth tbox) t = Γ, a consist of a finit set Γ of state type inclus assert (γ1 γ2), and of a finit set a of transit type inclus assert (α1 α2). the semant of alch( ,◦,¬,id) is model theoret and it is given in term of interpret transit system. as usual, state type ar interpret as set of state and transit type as set of state pair. definit 2. (semant of alch( ,◦,¬,id) ) an interpret transit system m for alch( ,◦,¬,id) is a  structur s, i where s is a non-empti set of state and i is a function such that: i(c) ⊆ s i(a) ⊆ s × s i(⊥) = ∅ i(¬γ) = Δm\ i(γ) i(γ1 γ2) = i(γ1) ∩ i(γ2) i(∀α.γ) = {s ∈ s | ∀t, (s, t) ∈ i(α) ⇒ t ∈ i(γ)} i(α1 α2) = i(α1) ∪ i(α2) i(¬α) = s × s \ i(α) i(α1 ◦ α2) = {(s, s ) | ∃s , (s, s ) ∈ i(α1) & (s , s ) ∈ i(α2)} i(id(γ)) = {(s, s) | s ∈ i(γ)} an interpret transit system m is a model of a state type  inclus assert γ1 γ2 if i(γ1) ⊆ i(γ2). it is a model of a transit type inclus assert α1 α2 if i(α1) ⊆ i(α2). an interpret transit system m is a model of a tbox t = Γ, a if m is a model of each inclus assert in Γ and a. remark 1. (deriv construct) the correspond between descript logic and dynam logic is well-known ([3]). in fact, the languag present in definit 1 and 2 is a notat variant of the languag of dynam logic ([5]) without the iter oper of transit type. as a consequ, some kei construct ar still defin in alch( ,◦,¬,id) . in particular we will make us of the follow definit of the if-then-els transit type: if γ then α1els α2 = (id(γ) ◦ α1) (id(¬γ) ◦ α2). boolean oper ar defin as usual. we will come back to some complex featur of thi logic in section 2.5. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 629 2.2 institut as terminolog we have upheld that institut impos new system  descript which ar formul in term of set of norm. the step toward a formal ground of thi view of institut is now short: norm can be thought of as terminolog axiom, and institut as set of terminolog axiom, i.e., terminolog box. an institut can be specifi as a terminolog box in = Γin, ain , where each inclus statement in Γin and ain model a norm of the institut. obvious, not everi tbox can be consid to be an institut specif. in particular, an institut specif in must have some precis linguist  relationship with the ‘brute" descript upon which the institut is specifi. we denot by lin the non-logic alphabet contain onli institut state and transit type, and by lbrute the  nonlog alphabet contain those type taken to talk about, instead, ‘brute" state and transit1 . definit 3. (institut as tbox) a tbox in = Γin, ain is an institut specif if: 1. the non-logic alphabet on which in is specifi contain element of both lin and lbrute. in symbol: l(in) ⊆ lin ∪ lbrute. 2. there exist set of terminolog axiom Γbridg ⊆ Γin and abridg ⊆ ain such that either the left-hand side of these axiom is alwai a descript express in lbrute and the right-hand side a descript express in lin, or those axiom ar definit. in symbol: if γ1 γ2 ∈ Γbridg then either γ1 ∈ lbrute and γ2 ∈ lin or it is the case that also γ2 γ1 ∈ Γbridg. the claus for abridg is analog. 3. the remain set of terminolog axiom Γin\Γbridg and ain\abridg ar all express in lin. in symbol: l(Γin\Γbridg) ⊆ lin and l(ain\abridg) ⊆ lin. the definit state that an institut specif need to be  express on a languag includ institut as well as brute term (1); that a part of the specif concern a descript of mere institut term (3); and that there need to be a part of the  specif which connect institut term to brute on (2).  terminolog axiom in Γbridg and abridg formal in dl the searlean notion of count-as condit ([25]), that is, rule  state what kind of mean an institut give to certain brute fact and transit (e.g., check box no.4 in form no.2 count as accept your person data to be us for research purpos). a formal theori of count-as statement ha been thoroughli  develop in a seri of paper among which [10, 13]. the technic content of the present paper heavili capit on that work. notic also that given the semant present in definit 2, if institut can be specifi via tbox then the mean of such specif is a set of interpret transit system, i.e., the model of those tbox. these transit system can be in turn thought of as all the possibl mass which model the specifi institut. remark 2. (lbrute from a design"s perspect) from a  design perspect languag lbrute ha to be thought of as the  languag on which a design would specifi a system instanti a given institut2 . definit 3 show that for such a design task 1 symbol from lin and lbrute will be index (especi with agent identifi) to add some syntact sugar. 2 to make a concret exampl, the am middlewar [7] can be view as a specif tool at a lbrute level. it is need to formal specifi an explicit bridg between the  concept us in the descript of the actual system and the  institut ‘abstract" concept. we will come back to thi issu in section 3. 2.3 from abstract to concret norm to illustr definit 3, and show it explanatori power, an exampl follow which depict an essenti phenomenon of  institut. exampl 1. (from abstract to concret norm) consid an institut suppos to regul access to a set of public web  servic. it mai contain the follow norm: it is forbidden to  discrimin access on the basi of citizenship. suppos now a  system ha to be built which compli with thi norm. the first question is: what doe it mean, in concret, to discrimin on the basi of citizenship? the system design should make some concret choic for interpret the norm and these choic should be kept track of in order to explicitli link the abstract norm to it concret interpret. the problem can be repres as follow. the abstract norm is formal by formula 1 by make us of a  standard reduct techniqu of deontic notion (see [16]): the  statement it is forbidden to discrimin on the basi of citizenship amount to the statement after everi execut of a transit of type discr(i, j) the system alwai end up in a violat state. togeth with the norm also some intuit background knowledg about the discrimin action need to be formal. here, as well as in the rest of the exampl in the paper, we provid just that part of the formal which is strictli function to show how the formal work in practic. formula 2 and 3 express two effect law: if the request j is dutch then after all execut of transit of type discr(i, j) j is accept by i, wherea if it is not all the execut of the transit of the same type have as an effect that it is not accept. all formula have to be read as schemata determin a finit number of subsumpt express depend on the number of agent i, j consid. ∀discr(i, j).viol ≡ (1) dutch(j) ∀discr(i, j).accept(j) (2) ¬dutch(j) ∀discr(i, j).¬accept(j) (3) the rest of the axiom concern the translat of the abstract type discr(i, j) to concret transit type. formula 4 refin it by make explicit that a precis if-then-els procedur count as a discriminatori act of agent i. formula 5 and 6 specifi which  messag of i to j count as accept and reject. if the design us transit type send(msg33, i, j) and send(msg38, i, j) for the concret system specif, then formula 5 and 6 can be thought of as bridg axiom connect notion belong to the institut alphabet (to accept, and to reject) to concret on (to send specif messag). final, formula 7 and 8 state two  intuit effect law concern the accept(i, j) and reject(i, j) type. if dutch(j)then accept(i, j) els reject(i, j) discr(i, j) (4) send(msg33, i, j) accept(i, j) (5) send(msg38, i, j) reject(i, j) (6) ∀accept(i, j).accept(j) ≡ (7) ∀reject(i, j).¬accept(j) ≡ (8) it is easi to see, on the ground of the semant expos in  definit 2, that the follow concret inclus statement hold w.r.t. 630 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) the specifi institut: if dutch(j) then send(msg33, i, j) els send(msg38, i, j) discr(i, j) (9) thi scenario exemplifi a pervas featur of human institut which, as extens argu in [10], should be incorpor by electron on. current formal approach to institut, such as island [6], do not allow for the formal specif of  explicit translat of abstract norm into concret on, and focu onli on norm that can be specifi at the concret system  specif level. what exampl 1 show is that the problem of the abstract of norm in institut can be formal address and can be given a precis formal semant. the scenario suggest that, just by modifi an appropri set of terminolog axiom, it is possibl for the design to obtain a differ institut by just modifi the set of bridg axiom without touch the terminolog axiom express onli in the institut languag lin. in fact, it is the case that a same set of abstract norm can be translat to differ and even incompat set of concret norm. thi translat can nevertheless not be arbitrari ([1]). exampl 2. (accept and unaccept translat of  abstract norm) reconsid again the scenario sketch in exampl 1. the transit type discr(i, j) ha been translat to a  complex procedur compos by concret transit type. would ani translat do? consid an altern institut specif in contain formula 1-3 and the follow translat rule: pai(j, i, e10) discr(i, j) (10) would thi formula be an accept translat of the abstract norm express in formula 1? the axiom state that transit where i receiv e10 from j count as transit of type discr(i, j). needless to sai thi is not intuit, becaus the abstract transit type discr(i, j) obei some intuit conceptu constraint  (formula 2 and 3) that all it translat should also obei. in fact, the follow inclus would then hold in in : dutch(j) ∀pai(j, i, e10).accept(j) (11) ¬dutch(j) ∀pai(j, i, e10).¬accept(j) (12) in fact, there properti of the transit type pai(j, i, e10) look at least awkward: if an agent is dutch than by pai e10 it would be accept, while if it wa not dutch the same action would make it not accept. the problem is that the mean of ‘pai" is not intuit subsum by the mean of ‘discrimin". in other word, a transit type pai(j, i, e10) doe not intuit yield the effect that a sub-type of discr(i, j) yield. it is on the contrari perfectli intuit that formula 9 obei the constraint in formula 2 and 3, which it doe, as it can be easili check on the ground of the semant. it is worth stress that without provid a model-theoret  semant for the translat rule link the institut notion to the brute on, it would not be so straightforward to model the  logic constraint to which the translat ar subject (exampl 2). thi is precis the advantag of view translat rule as  specif terminolog axiom, i.e., Γbridg and abridg, work as a bridg between two languag (definit 3). in [12], we have  thoroughli compar thi approach with approach such as [9] which conceiv of translat rule as infer rule. the two exampl have shown how our approach can account for some essenti featur of institut. in the next section the same framework is appli to provid a formal analysi of the notion of role. 2.4 institut modul and role view institut as the imposit of institut  descript on system" state and transit allow for analyz the norm system perspect itself (i.e., institut ar set of norm) at a finer granular. we have seen that the terminolog axiom specifi an institut concern complex descript of new institut notion. some of the institut state type  occur in the institut specif plai a kei role in structur the specif of the institut itself. the paradigmat exampl in thi sens ([25]) ar fact such as agent i enact role r which will be denot by state type rea(i, r). by state how an agent can enact and ‘deact" a role r, and what norm consequ follow from the enact of r, an institut describ expect form of agent" behavior while at the same time abstract from the concret agent take part to the system. the set of norm specifi an institut can be cluster on the ground of the rea state type. for each relev institut state type (e.g., rea(i, r)), the terminolog axiom which defin an institut, i.e., it norm, can be cluster in (possibl  overlap) set of three differ type: the axiom specifi how state of that institut type can be reach (e.g., how an agent i can enact the role r); how state of that type can be left (e.g., how an agent i can ‘deact" the a role r); and what kind of institut  consequ do those state bear (e.g., what right and power doe agent i acquir by enact role r). borrow the terminolog from work in legal and institut theori ([23, 25]), these cluster of norm can be call, respect, institut, termin and statu modul. statu modul we call statu modul those set of  terminolog axiom which specifi the institut consequ of the occurr of a given institut state-of-affair, for instanc, the fact that agent i enact role r. exampl 3. (a statu modul for role) enact a role within an institut bear some institut consequ that ar group under the notion of statu: by plai a role an agent acquir a specif statu. some of these consequ ar deontic and  concern the oblig, right, permiss under which the agent put itself onc it enact the role. an exampl which pertain to the  norm descript of the statu of both a buyer and a seller role is the follow: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) ∀¬pai(i, j, b).viol(i) (13) if agent i enact the buyer role and j the seller role and i win bid b then if i doe not perform a transit of type pai (i, j, b), i.e., doe not pai to j the price correspond to bid b, then the system end up in a state that the institut classifi as a violat state with i be the violat. notic that formula 13 formal at the same time an oblig pertain to the role buyer and a right pertain to the role seller. of particular interest ar then those consequ that attribut power to agent enact specif role: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) ∀bid(i, j, b).bid(i, j, b) (14) send(i, j, msg49) bid(i, j, b) (15) if agent i enact the buyer role and j the seller role, everi time agent i bid b to j thi action result in an institut state  testifi that the correspond bid ha been place by i (formula 14). formula 15 state how the bid action can be execut by send a specif messag to j (send(i, j, msg49)). some observ ar in order. as reader acquaint with  deontic logic have probabl alreadi notic, our treatment of the notion the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 631 of oblig (formula 13) make again us of a standard  reduct approach ([16]). more interest is instead how the notion of institut power is model. essenti, the empower phenomenon is analyz in term of two rule: on specifi the institut effect of an institut action (formula 14), and on translat the institut transit type in a brute on (formula 15). system of rule of thi type empow the agent enact some relev role by establish a connect between the brute action of the agent and some institut effect. whether the agent ar actual abl to execut the requir ‘brute" action is a differ issu, sinc agent i can be in some state (or even all state) unabl to effectu a send(i, j, msg49) transit. thi is the case also in human societi: priest ar empow to give rise to marriag but if a priest is not in state of perform the  requir speech act he is actual unabl to marri anybodi. there is a differ between be entitl to make a bid and be in state of make a bid ([4]). in other word, formula 14 and 15 express onli that agent plai the buyer role ar entitl to make bid. the actual possibl of perform the requir ‘brute"  action is not an institut issu, but rather an issu concern the implement of an institut in a concret system. we address thi issu extens in section 33 . institut modul we call institut modul those set of  terminolog axiom of an institut specif describ how state with certain institut properti can be reach, for  instanc, how an agent i can reach a state in which it enact role r. thei can be seen as procedur that the institut defin in order for the agent to bring institut state of affair about. exampl 4. (an institut modul for role) the fact that an agent i enact a role r (rea(i, r)) is the effect of a correspond enact action enact(i, r) perform under certain  circumst (formula 16), name that the agent doe not alreadi enact the role, and that the agent satisfi given condit (cond(i, r)), which might for instanc pertain the comput capabl requir for an agent to plai the chosen role, or it capabl to interact with some specif system"s infrastructur. formula 17 specifi instead the procedur count as an action of type enact(i, r). such a procedur is perform through a system  infrastructur s, which notifi to i that it ha been regist as  enact role r after send the necessari piec of data d (send(i, s, d)), e.g., a valid credit card number. ¬rea(i, r) cond(i, r) enact(i, r).rea(i, r) (16) send(i, s, d) ◦ notifi(s, i) enact(i, r) (17) termin modul analog, we call termin  modul those set of terminolog axiom state how a state with certain institut properti can be left. rule of thi kind state for instanc how an agent can stop enact a certain role. thei can be thu thought of as procedur that the institut defin in order for the agent to see to it that certain institut state stop hold. exampl 5. (a termin modul for role) termin  modul for role specifi, for instanc, how a transit type deact(i, r) can be execut which ha as consequ the reach of a state of type ¬rea(i, r): rea(i, r) deact(i, r).¬rea(i, r) (18) send(i, s, msg9) deact(i, r) (19) that is to sai, i deact a role r alwai lead to a state where 3 see in particular exampl 6 and definit 5 i doe not enact role r; and i send messag no.9 to a specif interfac infrastructur s count as i deact role r. exampl 3-5 have shown how role can be formal in our framework therebi get a formal semant: role ar also set of terminolog axiom concern state type of the sort rea(i, r). it is worth notic that thi model option is align with work on social theori address the concept of role such as [20]. 2.5 tractabl specif of institut in the previou section we fulli deploi the express of the languag introduc in section 2.1 and us it semant to provid a formal understand of mani essenti aspect of  institut in term of transit system. thi section spend a few word about the viabil of perform autom reason in the logic present. the satisfi problem4 in logic alch( ,◦,¬,id) is undecid sinc transit type inclus axiom correspond to a version of what in descript logic ar known as role-valu map and logic extend alc with role-valu map ar known to be undecid ([3]). tractabl (i.e., polynomi time decid) fragment of logic alch( ,◦,¬,id) can howev be isol which still exhibit some kei express featur. on of them is logic elh(◦) . it is  obtain from descript logic el, which contain onli state type intersect , existenti restrict ∃ and 5 , but extend with the ⊥ state type and with transit type inclus axiom of a  complex form: a1 ◦. . .◦an a (with n finit number). logic elh(◦) is also a fragment of the well investig descript logic el++ whose satisfi problem ha been shown in [2] to be decid in polynomi time. despit the veri limit express of thi fragment, some rudimentari institut specif can still be successfulli repres. specif, institut and termin modul can be repres which contain transit type  inclus axiom. restrict version of statu modul can also be repres enabl two essenti deontic notion: it is possibl (respect, imposs) to reach a violat state by perform a transit of a certain type, and it is possibl (respect,  imposs) to reach a legal state by perform a transit of a certain type. to thi aim languag lin would need to be expand with a set of state type {legal(i)}0≤i≤n whose intuit mean is to denot legal state as oppos to state of type viol(i). fragment like elh(◦) could be us as target logic within theori approxim approach ([24]) by aim at compil tbox express in alch( ,◦,¬,id) into approxim in those fragment. 3. from norm to structur 3.1 infrastructur in discuss exampl 3 we observ how be entitl to make a bid doe not impli be in state of make a bid. in other word, an institut can empow agent by mean of  appropri rule but thi empower can remain dead letter. similar 4 thi problem amount to check whether a state descript γ is satisfi w.r.t. a given tbox t, i.e., to check if there  exist a model m of t such that ∅ ⊂ i(γ). notic that languag alch( ,◦,¬,id) contain negat and intersect of arbitrari state type. it is well-known that if these oper ar avail then all most typic reason task at the tbox level can be  reduc to the satisfi problem. 5 notic therefor that el is a serious restrict fragment of alc sinc it doe not contain the negat oper for state type  (oper and ∀ remain thu undefin). 632 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) observ appli also to deontic notion: agent might be allow to perform certain transact under some relev condit but thei might be unabl to do so under those same condit. we  refer to thi kind of problem as infrastructur. the implement of an institut in a concret system call therefor for the design of appropri infrastructur or artifact ([19]). the formal  specif of an infrastructur amount to the formal specif of interact requir, that is to sai, the specif of which relev transit type ar execut and under what condit. definit 4. (infrastructur as tbox) an infrastructur inf = Γinf , ainf for institut in is a tbox on lbrute such that for all a ∈ l(abridg) there exist  terminolog axiom in Γinf of the follow form: γ ≡ ∃a. (a is execut exactli in γ state) and γ ≡ ∃¬a. (the negat of a is execut exactli in γ state). in other word, an infrastructur specif state all and onli the condit under which an atom brute transit type and it negat ar execut, which occur in the brute alphabet of the bridg axiom of in. it state what can be in concret done and under what condit. exampl 6. (infrastructur specif) consid the  institut specifi in exampl 1. a simpl infrastructur inf for that institut could contain for instanc the follow terminolog axiom for ani pair of differ agent i, j and messag type msg: ∃send(msg33, i, j). (20) the formula state that it is alwai in the possibl of agent i to send messag no. 33 to agent j. it then follow on the ground of exampl 1 that agent i can alwai accept agent j. ∃accept(i, j). (21) notic that the execut condit is just . we call a concret institut specif cin an institut specif in coupl with an infrastructur specif inf. definit 5. (concret institut) a concret institut obtain by join the institut in = Γin, ain and the infrastructur inf = Γinf , ainf is a tbox cin = Γ, a such that Γ = Γin ∪ Γinf and a = ain ∪ ainf . obvious, differ infrastructur can be devis for a same  institut give rise to differ concret institut which make precis implement choic explicit. of particular relev ar the implement choic concern abstract norm like the on repres in formula 13. a design can choos to regiment such norm ([15]), i.e., make violat state unreach, via an appropri infrastructur. exampl 7. (regiment via infrastructur specif) consid exampl 3 and suppos the follow translat rule to be also part of the institut: bnk(i, j, b) cc(i, j, b) ≡ pai(i, j, b) (22) condit pai(i, j, b) ≡ rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) (23) the first formula state how the payment can be concret carri out (via bank transfer or credit card) and the second just provid a concret label group the institut state type relev for the norm. in order to specifi a regiment at the infrastructur level it is enough to state that: condit pai(i, j, b) ≡ ∃(bnk(i, j, b) cc(i, j, b)). (24) ¬condit pai(i, j, b) ≡ ∃¬(bnk(i, j, b) cc(i, j, b)). (25) in other word, in state of type condit pai(i, j, b) the onli  execut brute action ar bank(i, j, b) or cc(i, j, b) and,  therefor, pai(i, j, b) would necessarili be execut. as a result, the follow inclus doe not hold with respect to the correspond concret institut: condit pai(i, j, b) ∃¬pai(i).viol(i). 3.2 organiz structur thi section briefli summar and adapt the perspect and result on organiz structur present in [14, 11]. we refer to that work for a more comprehens exposit. organiz structur typic concern the wai agent  interact within organ. these interact can be depict as the link of a graph defin on the set of role of the organ. such link ar then to be label on the basi of the type of interact thei stand for. first of all, it should be clear whether a link  denot that a certain interact between two role can, or ought to, or mai etc. take place. secondli, link should be label accord to the transit type α thei refer to and the condit γ in which that transit can, ought to, mai etc. take place. link in a  formal specif of an organiz structur stand therefor for statement of the kind: role r can (ought to, mai) execut α w.r.t. role s if γ is the case. for the sake of simplic, the follow definit will consid onli the can and ought-to interact modal. state and transit type in lin ∪lbrute will be us to label the link of the structur. interact modal can  therefor be of an institut kind or of a brute kind. definit 6. (organiz structur) an organiz structur is a multi-graph: os = role, {cp}p∈mod, {op}p∈mod where: • mod denot a set of pair p = γ : α, that is, a set of state type (condit) and transit type (action) pair of lin∪lbrute with α be an atom transit-type index with a pair (i, j) denot placehold for the actor and the recipi of the transit; • c (can) denot link to be interpret in term of the  execut of the relat α in γ, wherea o (ought) denot link to be interpret in term of the oblig to execut the relat α in γ. by the express (r, s) ∈ cγ:α and (r, s) ∈ oγ:α we mean  therefor: agent enact role r can and, respect, ought to interact with agent enact role s by perform α in state of type γ. as shown in [11] such formal represent of organiz structur ar of us for investig the structur properti  (robust, flexibl, etc.) that a given organ exhibit. at thi point all the formal mean ar put in place which allow us to formal repres institut as well as organiz  structur. the next and final step of the work consist in provid a formal relat between the two framework. thi formal  relat will make explicit how institut ar relat to organiz structur and vice versa. in particular, it will becom clear how a norm concept of the notion of role relat to a structur on, that is, how the view of role as a set of norm (specifi how an agent can enact and deact the role, and what social statu it obtain by do that) relat to the view of role as posit within social structur. 3.3 relat institut to organ the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 633 to translat a given concret institut into a correspond  organiz structur we need a function t assign pair of role to axiom. let us denot with sub the set of all state type inclus statement γ1 γ2 that can be express on lin ∪ lbrute.  function t is a partial function sub role × role such that, for ani x ∈ sub if x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α.  (execut) or x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (oblig) then t(x) = (r, s), where α is an atom transit-type index with a pair (i, j). that is to sai, execut and oblig law contain the enact configur rea(i, r) rea(j, s) as a premis and concern transit of type α, with i actor and j recipi of the α transit, ar translat into role pair (r, s). definit 7. (correspond of specif) a concret institut cin = Γ, a is said to correspond to an organiz structur os (and vice versa) if, for everi x ∈ Γ: • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. iff t(x) ∈ cγ:α • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) iff t(x) ∈ oγ:α intuit, function t take axiom from Γ (i.e., the set of state type terminolog axiom of cin) and yield pair of role.  definit 7 label the yield pair accordingli to the syntact form of the translat axiom. more concret, axiom of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. (execut law) ar  translat into the pair (r, s) belong to the execut dimens (i.e., c) of the organiz structur w.r.t. the execut of α  under circumst γ. analog, axiom of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (oblig law) ar translat into the pair (r, s) belong to the oblig dimens (i.e., o) of the organiz structur w.r.t. the execut of α under  circumst γ. leav technic asid, function t distil thu the terminolog and infrastructur constraint of cin into  structur on. the institut, termin and statu modul of role ar translat into definit of posit within a os. from a design perspect the interpret of definit 7 is twofold. on the on hand (from left to right), it can make  explicit what the structur consequ ar of a given institut support by a given infrastructur. on the other hand (from right to left), it can make explicit what kind of institut is actual  implement by a given organiz structur. let us see thi in some more detail. given a concret institut cin, definit 7 allow a design to be awar of the impact that specif terminolog choic (in particular, the choic of certain bridg axiom) and infrastructur on have at a structur level. notic that definit 7 support the infer of link in a structur. by check whether a given  inclus statement of the relev syntact form follow from cin (i.e., the so-call subsumpt problem of dl) it is possibl, via t, to add new link to the correspond organiz structur. thi can be recurs done by just ad ani new infer  inclus x to the previou set of axiom Γ, thu obtain an  updat institut specif contain Γ ∪ {x}. thi process can be thought of as the infer of structur link from  institut specif. in other word, it is possibl to us institut specif as infer tool for structur specif. for instanc, the infrastructur choic formal in exampl 7  impli that for the pair of role (buyer, seller), it is alwai the case that (buyer, seller) ∈ c :pai(i,j,b). thi link follow from link (buyer, seller) ∈ c :bnk(i,j,b) and (buyer, seller) ∈ c :cc(i,j,b) on the ground of the bridg axiom of the institut (formula 22). suppos now a design to be interest in a system which,  besid implement an institut, also incorpor an  organiz structur enjoi desir structur properti such as  flexibl, or robust6 . by relat structur link to state type  inclus it is therefor possibl to check whether ad a link in os result in a stronger institut specif, that is, if the correspond inclus statement is not alreadi impli by in. to draw a parallel with what just said in the previou  paragraph, thi process can be thought of as the infer of norm and infrastructur constraint from the specif of organiz structur. to give a simpl exampl consid again exampl 6 but from a revers perspect. suppos a design want a fulli  connect graph in the dimens c :send(i,j) of the organiz structur. exploit definit 7, we would obtain a number of  execut law in the fashion of formula 20 for all role in role (thu 2|role| axiom). definit 7 establish a correspond between two  essenti differ perspect on the design of open system allow for feedback between the two to be formal analyz. on last observ is in order. while given a concret institut an  organiz structur can be in principl fulli specifi (by  check for all -finit mani- relev inclus statement whether thei ar impli or not by the institut), it is not possibl to  obtain a full terminolog specif from an organiz  structur. thi li on the fact that in definit 6 the strictli  terminolog inform contain in the specif of an institut (emin, the set of transit type axiom a and therefor the bridg axiom) is lost while move to a structur descript. thi show, in turn, that the ad valu of the specif of  institut li precis in the terminolog link thei establish between institut and brute, i.e., system level notion. 4. conclus the paper aim at provid a comprehens formal  analysi of the institut metaphor and it relat to the  organiz on. the predomin formal tool ha been descript logic. tbox ha been us to repres the specif of  institut (definit 3) and their infrastructur (definit 6),  provid therefor a transit system semant for a number of  institut notion (exampl 1-7). multi-graph ha then been us to repres the specif of organiz structur (definit 6). the last result present concern the definit of a formal correspond between institut and organ specif (definit 7), which provid a formal wai for switch between the two paradigm. all in all, these result deliv a wai for relat abstract system specif (i.e., institut as set of norm) to specif that ar closer to an implement system (i.e.,  organiz structur). 5. refer [1] g. azzoni. il cavallo di caligola. in ontologia social poter deontico e regol costitut, page 45-54. quodlibet, macerata, itali, 2003.
