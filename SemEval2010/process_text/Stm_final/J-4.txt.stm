revenu analysi of a famili of rank rule for keyword auction s´ebastien lahai ∗ school of engin and appli scienc harvard univers, cambridg, ma 02138 slahai@eec.harvard.edu david m. pennock yahoo! research new york, ny 10011 pennockd@yahoo-inc.com abstract keyword auction lie at the core of the busi model of todai"s lead search engin. advertis bid for  placement alongsid search result, and ar charg for click on their ad. advertis ar typic rank accord to a score that take into account their bid and potenti  clickthrough rate. we consid a famili of rank rule that contain those typic us to model yahoo! and googl"s auction design as special case. we find that in gener neither of these is necessarili revenu-optim in  equilibrium, and that the choic of rank rule can be guid by consid the correl between bidder" valu and click-through rate. we propos a simpl approach to  determin a revenu-optim rank rule within our famili,  take into account effect on advertis satisfact and user experi. we illustr the approach us mont-carlo simul base on distribut fit to yahoo! bid and click-through rate data for a high-volum keyword. categori and subject descriptor j.4 [comput applic]: social and behavior  scienc-econom gener term econom, theori 1. introduct major search engin like googl, yahoo!, and msn sell advertis by auction off space on keyword search result page. for exampl, when a user search the web for ipod, the highest pai advertis (for exampl, appl or best bui) for that keyword mai appear in a separ sponsor section of the page abov or to the right of the algorithm result. the sponsor result ar displai in a format similar to algorithm result: as a list of item each contain a titl, a text descript, and a hyperlink to a web page. gener, advertis that appear in a higher posit on the page garner more attent and more click from user. thu, all els be equal, advertis prefer higher posit to lower posit. advertis bid for placement on the page in an  auctionstyl format where the larger their bid the more like their list will appear abov other ad on the page. by  convent, sponsor search advertis gener bid and pai per click, mean that thei pai onli when a user click on their ad, and do not pai if their ad is displai but not click. overtur servic, formerli goto.com and now own by yahoo! inc., is credit with pioneer sponsor search advertis. overtur"s success prompt a number of  compani to adopt similar busi model, most promin googl, the lead web search engin todai. microsoft"s msn, previous an affili of overtur, now oper it own keyword auction marketplac. sponsor search is on of the fastest grow, most effect, and most profit form of advertis, gener roughli $7 billion in revenu in 2005 after nearli doubl everi year for the previou five year. the search engin evalu the advertis" bid and  alloc the posit on the page accordingli. notic that,  although bid ar express as payment per click, the search engin cannot directli alloc click, but rather alloc impress, or placement on the screen. click relat onli stochast to impress. until recent, yahoo! rank bidder in decreas order of advertis" state valu per click, while googl rank in decreas order of advertis" state valu per impress. in googl"s case, valu per impress is comput by multipli the advertis"s  (perclick) bid by the advertis"s expect click-through rate, where thi expect mai consid a number of  unspecifi factor includ histor click-through rate, posit on the page, advertis ident, user ident, and the  context of other item on the page. we refer to these rule as rank-by-bid and rank-by-revenu, respect.1 we analyz a famili of rank rule that contain the  yahoo! and googl model as special case. we consid  rank1 these ar industri term. we will see, howev, that  rankbi-revenu is not necessarili revenu-optim. 50 ing rule where bidder ar rank in decreas order of score eq b, where e denot an advertis"s click-through rate (normal for posit) and b hi bid. notic that q = 0 correspond to yahoo!"s rank-by-bid rule and q = 1  correspond to googl"s rank-by-revenu rule. our premis is that bidder ar plai a symmetr equilibrium, as defin by edelman, ostrovski, and schwarz [3] and varian [11]. we show through simul that although q = 1 yield the effici alloc, set of q consider less than 1 can yield superior revenu in equilibrium under certain condit. the kei paramet is the correl between advertis valu and click-through rate. if thi correl is strongli posit, then smaller q ar revenu-optim. our simul ar base on distribut fit to data from yahoo! keyword auction. we propos that search engin set threshold of accept loss in advertis satisfact and user experi, then choos the revenu-optim q  consist with these constraint. we also compar the  potenti gain from tune q with the gain from set reserv price, and find that the former mai be much more  signific. in section 2 we give a formal model of keyword auction, and establish it equilibrium properti in section 3. in  section 4 we note that give agent bid credit can have the same effect as tune the rank rule explicitli. in  section 5 we give a gener formul of the optim keyword auction design problem as an optim problem, in a manner analog to the singl-item auction set. we then provid some theoret insight into how tune q can improv revenu, and why the correl between bidder" valu and click-through rate is relev. in section 6 we consid the effect of q on advertis satisfact and user experi. in section 7 we describ our simul and interpret their result. relat work. as mention the paper of edelman et al. [3] and varian [11] lai the groundwork for our studi. both paper independ defin an appeal refin of nash equilibrium for keyword auction and analyz it equilibrium properti. thei call thi refin  local envi-free equilibrium and symmetr equilibrium, respect. varian also provid some empir analysi. the gener model of keyword auction us here, where bidder ar rank accord to a weight time their bid, wa introduc by aggarw, goel, and motwani [1]. that paper also make a connect between the revenu of keyword auction in incomplet inform set with the revenu in symmetr equilibrium. iyengar and kumar [5] studi the optim keyword auction design problem in a set of incomplet inform, and also make the connect to symmetr equilibrium. we make us of thi connect when formul the optim auction design problem in our set. the work most close relat to our is that of feng, bhargava, and pennock [4]. thei were the first to realiz that the correl between bidder valu and click-through rate should be a kei paramet affect the revenu  perform of variou rank mechan. for simplic, thei assum bidder bid their true valu, so their model is veri differ from our and consequ so ar their find. accord to their simul, rank-by-revenu alwai (weakli) domin rank-by-bid in term of revenu, wherea our result suggest that rank-by-bid mai do much better for neg correl. lahai [8] give an exampl that suggest rank-by-bid should yield more revenu when valu and click-through rate ar posit correl, wherea rank-by-revenu should do better when the correl is neg. in thi work we make a deeper studi of thi conjectur. 2. model there ar k posit to be alloc among n bidder, where n > k. we assum that the (expect) click-through rate of bidder s in posit t is of the form esxt, i.e. separ into an advertis effect es ∈ [0, 1] and posit effect xt ∈ [0, 1]. we assum that x1 > x2 > . . . > xk > 0 and let xt = 0 for t > k. we also refer to es as the relev of bidder s. it is us to interpret xt as the probabl that an ad in posit t will be notic, and es as the probabl that it will be click on if notic. bidder s ha valu vs for each click. bidder have  quasilinear util, so that the util to bidder s of obtain posit t at a price of p per click is esxt(vs − p). a weight ws is associ with agent s, and agent bid for posit. if agent s bid bs, hi correspond score is wsb. agent ar rank by score, so that the agent with highest score is rank first, and so on. we assum throughout that agent ar number such that agent s obtain posit s. an agent pai per click the lowest bid necessari to retain hi posit, so that the agent in slot s pai ws+1 ws bs+1. the auction mai introduc a reserv score of r, so that an agent"s ad appear onli if hi score is at least r. for agent s, thi translat into a reserv price (minimum bid) of r/ws. 3. equilibrium we consid the pure-strategi nash equilibria of the  auction game. thi is a full-inform concept. the  motiv for thi choic is that in a keyword auction, bidder ar allow to continu adjust their bid over time, and henc obtain estim of their profit in variou posit. as a result it is reason to assum that if bid  stabil, bidder should be plai best-respons to each other"s bid [2, 3, 11]. formal, in a nash equilibrium of thi game the follow inequ hold. esx „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws bt+1 « ∀t > s (1) esx „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt ws bt « ∀t < s (2) inequ (1) and (2) state that bidder s doe not prefer a lower or higher posit to hi own, respect. it can be hard to deriv ani theoret insight into the properti of these nash equilibria-multipl alloc of posit to bidder can potenti aris in equilibrium [2].  edelman, ostrovski, and schwarz [3] introduc a refin of nash equilibrium call local envi-free equilibrium that is more tractabl to analyz; varian [11] independ  propos thi solut concept and call it symmetr  equilibrium. in a symmetr equilibrium, inequ (1) hold for all s, t rather than just for t > s. so for all s and all t = s, we have esx „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws bt+1 « , 51 or equival xs(wsv − ws+1bs+1) ≥ xt(wsv − wt+1bt+1). (3) edelman et al. [3] note that thi equilibrium aris if agent ar rais their bid to increas the payment of those abov them, a practic which is believ to be common in actual keyword auction. varian [11] provid some empir  evid that googl bid data agre well with the hypothesi that bidder ar plai a symmetr equilibrium. varian doe a thorough analysi of the properti of  symmetr equilibrium, assum ws = es = 1 for all bidder. it is straightforward to adapt hi analysi to the case where bidder ar assign arbitrari weight and have separ click-through rate.2 as a result we find that in symmetr equilibrium, bidder ar rank in order of decreas wsv. to be clear, although the auction onli ha access to the bid bs and not the valu vs, in symmetr equilibrium the bid ar such that rank accord to wsb is equival to rank accord to wsv. the smallest possibl bid profil that can aris in  symmetr equilibrium is given by the recurs xsw+1bs+1 = (xs − xs+1)ws+1vs+1 + xs+1ws+2bs+2. in thi work we assum that bidder ar plai the smallest symmetr equilibrium. thi is an appropri select for our purpos: by optim revenu in thi equilibrium, we ar optim a lower bound on the revenu in ani  symmetr equilibrium. unravel the recurs yield xsw+1bs+1 = kx t=s (xt − xt+1)wt+1vt+1. (4) agent s"s total expect payment is es/ws time the  quantiti on the left-hand side of (4). the base case of the  recurs occur for s = k, where we find that the first exclud bidder bid hi true valu, as in the origin analysi. multipli each of the inequ (4) by the  correspond es/ws to obtain total payment, and sum over all posit, we obtain a total equilibrium revenu of kx s=1 kx t=s wt+1 ws es(xt − xt+1)vt+1. (5) to summar, the minimum possibl revenu in symmetr equilibrium can be comput as follow, given the agent" relev-valu pair (es, vs): first rank the agent in  decreas order of wsv, and then evalu (5). with a reserv score of r, it follow from inequ (3) that no bidder with wsv < r would want to particip in the auction. let k(r) be the number of bidder with wsv ≥ r, and assum it is at most k. we can impos a reserv score of r by introduc a bidder with valu r and weight 1, and make him the first exclud bidder (who in symmetr equilibrium bid truthfulli). in thi case the recurs yield xsw+1bs+1 = k(r)−1 x t=s (xt − xt+1)wt+1vt+1 + xk(r)r and the revenu formula is adapt similarli. 2 if we redefin wsv to be vs and wsb to be bs, we  recov varian"s setup and hi origin analysi goe through unchang. 4. bid credit an indirect wai to influenc the alloc is to introduc bid credit.3 suppos bidder s is onli requir to pai a fraction cs ∈ [0, 1] of the price he face, or equival a (1 − cs) fraction of hi click ar receiv for free. then in a symmetr equilibrium, we have esx „ vs − ws+1 ws csb+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws csbt+1 « or equival xs „ ws cs vs − ws+1bs+1 « ≥ xt „ ws cs vs − wt+1bt+1 « . if we defin ws = ws cs and bs = csb, we recov  inequ (3). henc the equilibrium revenu will be as if we had us weight w rather than w. the bid will be scale  version of the bid that aris with weight w (and no credit), where each bid is scale by the correspond factor 1/cs. thi techniqu allow on to us credit instead of explicit chang in the weight to affect revenu. for instanc,  rankbi-revenu will yield the same revenu as rank-by-bid if we set credit to cs = es. 5. revenu we ar interest in set the weight w to achiev  optim expect revenu. the setup is as follow. the  auction choos a function g so that the weight scheme is ws ≡ g(es). we do not consid weight that also depend on the agent" bid becaus thi would invalid the  equilibrium analysi of the previou section.4 a pool of n bidder is then obtain by i.i.d. draw of valu-relev pair from a common probabl densiti f(es, vs). we assum the  densiti is continu and ha full support on [0, 1]×[0, ∞). the revenu to the auction is then the revenu gener in symmetr equilibrium under weight scheme w. thi  assum the auction is patient enough not to care about revenu until bid have stabil. the problem of find an optim weight scheme can be formul as an optim problem veri similar to the on deriv by myerson [9] for the singl-item auction case (with incomplet inform). let qsk(e, v; w) = 1 if agent s obtain slot k in equilibrium under weight scheme w, where e = (e1, . . . , en ) and v = (v1, . . . , vn ), and let it be 0 otherwis. note that the total payment of agent s in equilibrium is esx ws+1 ws bs+1 = kx t=s es(xt − xt+1) wt+1 ws vt+1 = esxsv − z vs 0 kx k=1 esxkqsk(es, e−s, y, v−s; w) dy. the deriv then continu just as in the case of a  singleitem auction [7, 9]. we take the expect of thi payment, 3 hal varian suggest to us that bid credit could be us to affect revenu in keyword auction, which prompt us to look into thi connect. 4 the analysi doe not gener to weight that depend on bid. it is unclear whether an equilibrium would exist at all with such weight. 52 and sum over all agent to obtain the object z ∞ 0 z ∞ 0 " nx s=1 kx k=1 esxkψ(es, vs)qsk(e, v; w) # f(e, v) dv de, where ψ is the virtual valuat ψ(es, vs) = vs − 1 − f(vs|es) f(vs|es) . accord to thi analysi, we should rank bidder by  virtual score esψ(es, vs) to optim revenu (and exclud ani bidder with neg virtual score). howev, unlik in the incomplet inform set, here we ar constrain to rank rule that correspond to a certain weight scheme ws ≡ g(es). we remark that the virtual score cannot be reproduc exactli via a weight scheme. lemma 1. there is no weight scheme g such that the virtual score equal the score, for ani densiti f. proof. assum there is a g such that eψ(e, v) = g(e)v. (the subscript s is suppress for clariti.) thi is equival to d dv log(1 − f(v|e)) = h(e)/v, (6) where h(e) = (g(e)/e−1)−1 . let ¯v be such that f(¯v|e) < 1; under the assumpt of full support, there is alwai such a ¯v. integr (6) with respect to v from 0 to ¯v, we find that the left-hand side converg wherea the right-hand side diverg, a contradict. of cours, to rank bidder by virtual score, we onli need g(es)vs = h(esψ(es, vs)) for some monoton increas transform h. (a necessari condit for thi is that ψ(es, vs) be increas in vs for all es.) absent thi  regular condit, the optim problem seem quit difficult becaus it is so gener: we need to maxim expect  revenu over the space of all function g. to simplifi matter, we now restrict our attent to the famili of weight ws = eq s for q ∈ (−∞, +∞). it should be much simpler to find the optimum within thi famili, sinc it is just on-dimension. note that it cover rank-by-bid (q = 0) and rank-by-revenu (q = 1) as special case. to see how tune q can improv matter, consid again the equilibrium revenu: r(q) = kx s=1 kx t=s „ et+1 es «q es(xt − xt+1)vt+1. (7) if the bidder ar rank in decreas order of relev, then et es ≤ 1 for t > s and decreas q slightli without affect the alloc will increas revenu. similarli, if bidder ar rank in increas order of relev,  increas q slightli will yield an improv. now suppos there is perfect posit correl between valu and relev. in thi case, rank-by-bid will alwai lead to the same  alloc as rank-by-revenu, and bidder will alwai be rank in decreas order of relev. it then follow from (7) that q = 0 will yield more revenu in equilibrium than q = 1.5 5 it mai appear that thi contradict the revenu-equival theorem [7, 9], becaus mechan that alwai lead to the same alloc in equilibrium should yield the same  revenu. note though that with perfect correl, there ar if a good estim of f is avail, mont-carlo  simul can be us to estim the revenu curv as a function of q, and the optimum can be locat. simul can also be us to quantifi the effect of correl on the locat of the optimum. we do thi in section 7. 6. effici and relev in principl the revenu-optim paramet q mai lie  anywher in (−∞, ∞). howev, tune the rank rule also ha consequ for advertis satisfact and user  experi, and take these into account reduc the rang of allow q. the total relev of the equilibrium alloc is l(q) = kx s=1 esx, i.e. the aggreg click-through rate. presum user find the ad displai more interest and less of a nuisanc if thei ar more inclin to click on the ad, so we adopt total relev as a measur of user experi. let ps = ws+1 ws bs+1 be the price per click face by bidder s. the total valu (effici) gener by the auction in equilibrium is v (q) = kx s=1 esxsv = kx s=1 esx(vs − ps) + kx s=1 esxsp. as we see total valu can be reinterpret as total profit to the bidder and auction combin. sinc we onli  consid deviat from maximum effici that increas the auction"s profit, ani decreas in effici in our set correspond to a decreas in bidder profit. we therefor adopt effici as a measur of advertis satisfact. we would expect total relev to increas with q, sinc more weight is place on each bidder"s individu relev. we would expect effici to be maxim at q = 1, sinc in thi case a bidder"s weight is exactli hi relev. proposit 1. total relev is non-decreas in q. proof. recal that in symmetr equilibrium, bidder ar rank in order of decreas wsv. let > 0. perform an exchang sort to obtain the rank that aris with q + start from the rank that aris with q (for a descript of exchang sort and it properti, see knuth [6] pp.  106110). assum that is larg enough to make the rank distinct. agent s and t, where s is initi rank lower than t, ar swap in the process if and onli if the follow condit hold: eq sv ≤ eq t vt eq+ s vs > eq+ t vt which togeth impli that es > et and henc es > et as > 0. at some point in the sort, agent s occupi some slot α, β such that vs = αes + β. so the assumpt of full  support is violat, which is necessari for revenu equival. recal that a densiti ha full support over a given domain if everi point in the domain ha posit densiti. 53 k while agent t occupi slot k − 1. after the swap, total relev will have chang by the amount esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk = (es − et)(xk−1 − xk) > 0 as relev strictli increas with each swap in the sort, total relev is strictli greater when us q + rather than q. proposit 2. total valu is non-decreas in q for q ≤ 1 and non-increas in q for q ≥ 1. proof. let q ≥ 1 and let > 0. perform an exchang sort to obtain the second rank from the first as in the previou proof. if agent s and t ar swap, where s wa initi rank lower than t, then es > et. thi follow by the same reason as in the previou proof. now e1−q s ≤ e1−q t as 1 − q ≤ 0. thi togeth with eq sv ≤ eq t vt impli that esv ≤ etvt. henc after swap agent s and t, total valu ha not increas. the case for q ≤ 1 is similar. sinc the trend describ in proposit 1 and 2 hold pointwis (i.e. for ani set of bidder), thei also hold in  expect. proposit 2 confirm that effici is inde maxim at q = 1. these result motiv the follow approach. although tune q can optim current revenu, thi mai come at the price of futur revenu becaus advertis and user mai be lost, see as their satisfact decreas. to guarante futur revenu will not be hurt too much, the auction can impos bound on the percent effici and relev loss he is will to toler, with q = 1 be a natur baselin. by proposit 2, a lower bound on effici will yield upper and lower bound on the search space for q. by proposit 1, a lower bound on relev will yield anoth lower bound on q. the revenu curv can then be plot within the allow rang of q to find the revenu-optim set. 7. simul to add a measur of realiti to our simul, we fit distribut for valu and relev to yahoo! bid and  clickthrough rate data for a certain keyword that draw over a million search per month. (we do not reveal the ident of the keyword to respect the privaci of the advertis.) we obtain click and impress data for the advertis bid on the keyword. from thi we estim advertis and posit effect us a maximum-likelihood criterion. we found that, inde, posit effect ar monoton decreas with lower rank. we then fit a beta distribut to the advertis effect result in paramet a = 2.71 and b = 25.43. we obtain bid of advertis for the keyword. us varian"s [11] techniqu, we deriv bound on the bidder" actual valu given these bid. by thi techniqu, upper and lower bound ar obtain on bidder valu given the bid accord to inequ (3). if the interv for a given valu is empti, i.e. it upper bound li below it lower bound, then we comput the smallest perturb to the bid necessari to make the interv non-empti, which involv solv a quadrat program. we found that the mean absolut  deviat requir to fit bid to symmetr equilibrium wa 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 valu densiti 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0 2 4 6 8 10 relev densiti figur 1: empir margin distribut of valu and relev. alwai at most 0.08, and usual significantli less, over  differ dai in a period of two week.6 we fit a lognorm distribut to the lower bound on the bidder" valu,  result in paramet μ = 0.35 and σ = 0.71. the empir distribut of valu and relev togeth with the fit lognorm and beta curv ar given in  figur 1. it appear that mixtur of beta and lognorm  distribut might be better fit, but sinc these distribut ar us mainli for illustr purpos, we err on the side of simplic. we us a gaussian copula to creat depend between valu and relev.7 given the margin distribut for valu and relev togeth with thi copula, we simul the revenu effect of vari q for differ level of  spearman correl, with 12 slot and 13 bidder. the result ar shown in figur 2.8 it is appar from the figur that the optim choic of q move to the right as correl decreas; thi agre with our intuit from section 5. the choic is veri sensit to the level of correl. if choos onli between  rankbi-bid and rank-by-revenu, rank-by-bid is best for posit correl wherea rank-by-revenu is best for neg  correl. at zero correl, thei give about the same  expect revenu in thi instanc. figur 2 also show that in principl, the optim q mai be neg. it mai also occur beyond 1 for differ distribut, but we do not know if these would be realist. the trend in effici and relev ar as describ in the result from section 6. (ani small deviat from these trend is due to the  random inher in the simul.) the curv level off as q → +∞ becaus eventu agent ar rank pure accord to relev, and similarli as q → −∞. a typic spearman correl between valu and  relev for the keyword wa about 0.4-for differ dai in a week the correl lai within [0.36, 0.55]. simul  result with thi correl ar in figur 3. in thi instanc rank-by-bid is in fact optim, yield 25% more revenu than rank-by-revenu. howev, at q = 0 effici and  relev ar 9% and 17% lower than at q = 1, respect. impos a bound of, sai, 5% on effici and relev loss from the baselin at q = 1, the optim set is q = 0.6, yield 11% more revenu than the baselin. 6 see varian [11] for a definit of mean absolut deviat. 7 a copula is a function that take margin distribut and give a joint distribut with these margin. it can be design so that the variabl ar correl. see for exampl nelsen [10]. 8 the y-ax in figur 2-4 have been normal becaus the simul ar base on proprietari data. onli rel valu ar meaning. 54 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 r(q) q revenu 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 v(q) q effici 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 l(q) q relev figur 2: revenu, effici, and relev for differ paramet q under vari spearman correl (kei at right). estim standard error ar less than 1% of the valu shown. -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 r(q) q revenu 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 v(q) q effici 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 l(q) q relev figur 3: revenu, effici, and relev for differ paramet q with spearman correl of 0.4. estim standard error ar less than 1% of the valu shown. we also look into the effect of introduc a reserv score. result ar shown in figur 4. natur, both  effici and relev suffer with an increas reserv score. the optim set is r = 0.2, which give onli an 8%  increas in revenu from r = 0. howev, it result in a 13% effici loss and a 26% relev loss. tune weight seem to be a much more desir approach than  introduc a reserv score in thi instanc. the reason why effici and relev suffer more with a reserv score is that thi approach will often exclud  bidder entir, wherea thi never occur when tune weight. the two approach ar not mutual exclus, howev, and some combin of the two might prove better than either alon, although we did not investig thi possibl. 8. conclus in thi work we look into the revenu properti of a famili of rank rule that contain the yahoo! and googl model as special case. in practic, it should be veri  simpl to move between rule within the famili: thi simpli  involv chang the expon q appli to advertis effect. we also show that, in principl, the same effect could be obtain by us bid credit. despit the simplic of the rule chang, simul reveal that properli  tune q can significantli improv revenu. in the simul, the revenu improv were greater than what could be obtain us reserv price. on the other hand, we show that advertis  satisfact and user experi could suffer if q is made too small. we propos that the auction set bound on the decreas in advertis and user satisfact he is will to toler, which would impli bound on the rang of allow q. with appropri estim for the distribut of valu and  relev, and knowledg of their correl, the revenu curv can then be plot within thi rang to locat the optimum. there ar sever wai to push thi research further. it would be interest to do thi analysi for a varieti of  keyword, to see if the optim set of q is alwai so sensit to the level of correl. if it is, then simpli us  rank-bybid where there is posit correl, and rank-by-revenu where there is neg correl, could be fine to a first  approxim and alreadi improv revenu. it would also be interest to compar the effect of tune q versu reserv price for keyword that have few bidder. in thi instanc reserv price should be more competit, but thi is still an open question. in principl the minimum revenu in nash equilibrium can be found by linear program. howev, mani  alloc can aris in nash equilibrium, and a linear program need to be solv for each of these. there is as yet no effici wai to enumer all possibl nash alloc, so find the minimum revenu is current infeas. if thi problem could be solv, we could run simul for nash equilibrium instead of symmetr equilibrium, to see if our insight ar robust to the choic of solut concept. larger class of rank rule could be relev. for  instanc, it is possibl to introduc discount ds and rank  accord to wsb − ds; the equilibrium analysi gener to thi case as well. with thi larger class the virtual score can equal the score, e.g. in the case of a uniform margin distribut over valu. it is unclear, though, whether such extens help with more realist distribut. 55 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 r(r) r revenu 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 v(r) r effici 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 l(r) r relev figur 4: revenu, effici, and relev for differ reserv score r, with spearman correl of 0.4 and q = 1. estim ar averag over 1000 sampl. acknowledg we thank pavel berkhin, chad carson, yile chen, ashvin kannan, darshan kantak, chri luvogt, jan pedersen, michael schwarz, tong zhang, and other member of yahoo!
