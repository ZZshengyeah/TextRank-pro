comput good nash equilibria in graphic game ∗ edith elkind hebrew univers of jerusalem, israel, and univers of southampton, southampton, so17 1bj, u.k. lesli ann goldberg univers of liverpool liverpool l69 3bx, u.k. paul goldberg univers of liverpool liverpool l69 3bx, u.k. abstract thi paper address the problem of fair equilibrium select in graphic game. our approach is base on the data structur call the best respons polici, which wa propos by kearn et al. [13] as a wai to repres all nash equilibria of a graphic game. in [9], it wa shown that the best respons polici ha polynomi size as long as the underli graph is a path. in thi paper, we show that if the underli graph is a bound-degre tree and the best respons polici ha polynomi size then there is an effici  algorithm which construct a nash equilibrium that guarante certain payoff to all particip. anoth attract solut concept is a nash equilibrium that maxim the social welfar. we show that, while exactli comput the latter is infeas (we prove that  solv thi problem mai involv algebra number of an arbitrarili high degre), there exist an fpta for find such an equilibrium as long as the best respons polici ha polynomi size. these two algorithm can be combin to produc nash equilibria that satisfi variou fair criteria. categori and subject descriptor f.2 [theori of comput]: analysi of algorithm and  problem complex; j.4 [comput applic]: social and  behavior scienc-econom gener term algorithm, econom, theori 1. introduct in a larg commun of agent, an agent"s behavior is not like to have a direct effect on most other agent: rather, it is just the agent who ar close enough to him that will be affect. howev, as these agent respond by adapt their behavior, more agent will feel the consequ and eventu the choic made by a singl agent will propag throughout the entir commun. thi is the intuit behind graphic game, which were  introduc by kearn, littman and singh in [13] as a compact  represent scheme for game with mani player. in an n-player  graphic game, each player is associ with a vertex of an underli graph g, and the payoff of each player depend on hi action as well as on the action of hi neighbor in the graph. if the  maximum degre of g is Δ, and each player ha two action avail to him, then the game can be repres us n2Δ+1 number. in contrast, we need n2n number to repres a gener n-player 2-action game, which is onli practic for small valu of n. for graphic game with constant Δ, the size of the game is linear in n. on of the most natur problem for a graphic game is that of find a nash equilibrium, the exist of which follow from nash"s celebr theorem (as graphic game ar just a special case of n-player game). the first attempt to tackl thi problem wa made in [13], where the author consid graphic game with two action per player in which the underli graph is a  boundeddegre tree. thei propos a gener algorithm for find nash equilibria that can be special in two wai: an exponenti-time algorithm for find an (exact) nash equilibrium, and a fulli  polynomi time approxim scheme (fpta) for find an  approxim to a nash equilibrium. for ani > 0 thi algorithm  output an -nash equilibrium, which is a strategi profil in which no player can improv hi payoff by more than by unilater chang hi strategi. while -nash equilibria ar often easier to comput than exact nash equilibria, thi solut concept ha sever drawback. first, the player mai be sensit to a small loss in payoff, so the  strategi profil that is an -nash equilibrium will not be stabl. thi will be the case even if there is onli a small subset of player who ar extrem price-sensit, and for a larg popul of player it mai be difficult to choos a valu of that will satisfi everyon. second, the strategi profil that ar close to be nash equilibria mai be much better with respect to the properti under  consider than exact nash equilibria. therefor, the (approxim to the) valu of the best solut that correspond to an -nash  equilibrium mai not be indic of what can be achiev under an exact nash equilibrium. thi is especi import if the purpos of the approxim solut is to provid a good benchmark for a system of selfish agent, as the benchmark impli by an -nash equilibrium mai be unrealist. for these reason, in thi paper we focu on the problem of comput exact nash equilibria. build on idea of [14], elkind et al. [9] show how to find an (exact) nash equilibrium in polynomi time when the underli 162 graph ha degre 2 (that is, when the graph is a collect of path and cycl). by contrast, find a nash equilibrium in a gener degre-bound graph appear to be computation intract: it ha been shown (see [5, 12, 7]) to be complet for the complex class ppad. [9] extend thi hard result to the case in which the underli graph ha bound pathwidth. a graphic game mai not have a uniqu nash equilibrium,  inde it mai have exponenti mani. moreov, some nash  equilibria ar more desir than other. rather than have an  algorithm which mere find some nash equilibrium, we would like to have algorithm for find nash equilibria with variou  sociallydesir properti, such as maxim overal payoff or  distribut profit fairli. a us properti of the data structur of [13] is that it  simultan repres the set of all nash equilibria of the underli game. if thi represent ha polynomi size (as is the case for path, as shown in [9]), on mai hope to extract from it a nash equilibrium with the desir properti. in fact, in [13] the author mention that thi is inde possibl if on is interest in find an (approxim) -nash equilibrium. the goal of thi paper is to extend thi to exact nash equilibria. 1.1 our result in thi paper, we studi n-player 2-action graphic game on bound-degre tree for which the data structur of [13] ha size poli(n). we focu on the problem of find exact nash equilibria with certain social-desir properti. in particular, we show how to find a nash equilibrium that (nearli) maxim the social welfar, i.e., the sum of the player" payoff, and we show how to find a nash equilibrium that (nearli) satisfi prescrib payoff bound for all player. graphic game on bound-degre tree have a simpl  algebra structur. on attract featur, which follow from [13], is that everi such game ha a nash equilibrium in which the strategi of everi player is a ration number. section 3 studi the algebra structur of those nash equilibria that maxim social welfar. we show (theorem 1 and 2) that, surprisingli, the set of nash  equilibria that maxim social welfar is more complex. in fact, for ani algebra number α ∈ [0, 1] with degre at most n, we exhibit a graphic game on a path of length o(n) such that, in the uniqu social welfar-maxim nash equilibrium of thi game, on of the player plai the mix strategi α.1 thi result show that it mai be difficult to repres an optim nash equilibrium. it seem to be a novel featur of the set we consid here, that an optim nash equilibrium is hard to repres, in a situat where it is easi to find and repres a nash equilibrium. as the social welfar-maxim nash equilibrium mai be hard to repres effici, we have to settl for an approxim. howev, the crucial differ between our approach and that of previou paper [13, 16, 19] is that we requir our algorithm to  output an exact nash equilibrium, though not necessarili the optim on with respect to our criteria. in section 4, we describ an  algorithm that satisfi thi requir. name, we propos an  algorithm that for ani > 0 find a nash equilibrium whose total  payoff is within of optim. it run in polynomi time (theorem 3,4) for ani graphic game on a bound-degre tree for which the data structur propos by [13] (the so-call best respons polici,  defin below) is of size poli(n) (note that, as shown in [9], thi is alwai the case when the underli graph is a path). more  pre1 a relat result in a differ context wa obtain by datta [8], who show that n-player 2-action game ar univers in the sens that ani real algebra varieti can be repres as the set of total mix nash equilibria of such game. cise, the run time of our algorithm is polynomi in n, pmax, and 1/ , where pmax is the maximum absolut valu of an entri of a payoff matrix, i.e., it is a pseudopolynomi algorithm, though it is fulli polynomi with respect to . we show (section 4.1) that under some restrict on the payoff matric, the algorithm can be transform into a (truli) polynomi-time algorithm that  output a nash equilibrium whose total payoff is within a 1 − factor from the optim. in section 5, we consid the problem of find a nash  equilibrium in which the expect payoff of each player vi exce a prescrib threshold ti. us the idea from section 4 we give (theorem 5) a fulli polynomi time approxim scheme for thi problem. the run time of the algorithm is bound by a  polynomi in n, pmax, and . if the instanc ha a nash equilibrium satisfi the prescrib threshold then the algorithm construct a nash equilibrium in which the expect payoff of each player vi is at least ti − . in section 6, we introduc other natur criteria for select a good nash equilibrium and we show that the algorithm  describ in the two previou section can be us as build block in find nash equilibria that satisfi these criteria. in particular, in section 6.1 we show how to find a nash equilibrium that  approxim the maximum social welfar, while guarante that each individu payoff is close to a prescrib threshold. in section 6.2 we show how to find a nash equilibrium that (nearli) maxim the minimum individu payoff. final, in section 6.3 we show how to find a nash equilibrium in which the individu payoff of the player ar close to each other. 1.2 relat work our approxim scheme (theorem 3 and theorem 4) show a contrast between the game that we studi and two-player n-action game, for which the correspond problem ar usual intract. for two-player n-action game, the problem of find nash  equilibria with special properti is typic np-hard. in particular, thi is the case for nash equilibria that maxim the social welfar [11, 6]. moreov, it is like to be intract even to approxim such equilibria. in particular, chen, deng and teng [4] show that there exist some , invers polynomi in n, for which comput an -nash equilibrium in 2-player game with n action per player is ppad-complet. lipton and markaki [15] studi the algebra properti of nash equilibria, and point out that standard quantifi elimin  algorithm can be us to solv them. note that these algorithm ar not polynomi-time in gener. the game we studi in thi  paper have polynomi-time comput nash equilibria in which all mix strategi ar ration number, but an optim nash  equilibrium mai necessarili includ mix strategi with high algebra degre. a correl equilibrium (ce) (introduc by aumann [2]) is a distribut over vector of player" action with the properti that if ani player is told hi own action (the valu of hi own  compon) from a vector gener by that distribut, then he cannot increas hi expect payoff by chang hi action. ani nash equilibrium is a ce but the convers doe not hold in gener. in contrast with nash equilibria, correl equilibria can be found for low-degre graphic game (as well as other class of  conciselyrepres multiplay game) in polynomi time [17]. but, for graphic game it is np-hard to find a correl equilibrium that maxim total payoff [18]. howev, the np-hard result  appli to more gener game than the on we consid here, in  particular the graph ar not tree. from [2] it is also known that there exist 2-player, 2-action game for which the expect total payoff 163 of the best correl equilibrium is higher than the best nash  equilibrium, and we discuss thi issu further in section 7. 2. preliminari and notat we consid graphic game in which the underli graph g is an n-vertex tree, in which each vertex ha at most Δ children. each vertex ha two action, which ar denot by 0 and 1. a mix strategi of a player v is repres as a singl number v ∈ [0, 1], which denot the probabl that v select action 1. for the purpos of the algorithm, the tree is root arbitrarili. for conveni, we assum without loss of gener that the root ha a singl child, and that it payoff is independ of the action chosen by the child. thi can be achiev by first choos an arbitrari root of the tree, and then ad a dummi parent of thi root, give the new parent a constant payoff function, e.g., 0. given an edg (v, w ) of the tree g, and a mix strategi w for w , let g(v,w ),w =w be the instanc obtain from g by (1) delet all node z which ar separ from v by w (i.e., all node z such that the path from z to v pass through w ), and (2) restrict the instanc so that w is requir to plai mix  strategi w. definit 1. suppos that (v, w ) is an edg of the tree, that v is a mix strategi for v and that w is a mix strategi for w . we sai that v is a potenti best respons to w (denot by v ∈ pbrv (w)) if there is an equilibrium in the instanc g(v,w ),w =w in which v ha mix strategi v. we defin the best respons polici for v , given w , as b(w, v ) = {(w, v) | v ∈ pbrv (w), w ∈ [0, 1]}. the upstream pass of the gener algorithm of [13] consid  everi node v (other than the root) and comput the best respons polici for v given it parent. with the abov assumpt about the root, the downstream pass is straightforward. the root select a mix strategi w for the root w and a mix strategi v ∈ b(w, v ) for each child v of w . it instruct each child v to plai v. the  remaind of the downward pass is recurs. when a node v is instruct by it parent to adopt mix strategi v, it doe the  follow for each child u - it find a pair (v, u) ∈ b(v, u) (with the same v valu that it wa given by it parent) and instruct u to plai u. the best respons polici for a vertex u given it parent v can be repres as a union of rectangl, where a rectangl is defin by a pair of close interv (iv , iu ) and consist of all point in iv × iu ; it mai be the case that on or both of the interv iv and iu consist of a singl point. in order to perform comput on b(v, u), and to bound the number of rectangl, [9] us the notion of an event point, which is defin as follow. for ani set a ⊆ [0, 1]2 that is repres as a union of a finit number of rectangl, we sai that a point u ∈ [0, 1] on the u-axi is a  uevent point of a if u = 0 or u = 1 or the represent of a contain a rectangl of the form iv × iu and u is an endpoint of iu ; v -event point ar defin similarli. for mani game consid in thi paper, the underli graph is an n-vertex path, i.e., a graph g = (v, e) with v = {v1, . . . , vn} and e = {(v1, v2), . . . , (vn−1, vn)}. in [9], it wa shown that for such game, the best respons polici ha onli polynomi-mani rectangl. the proof that the number of rectangl in b(vj+1, vj) is polynomi proce by first show that the number of event point in b(vj+1, vj ) cannot exce the number of event point in b(vj, vj−1) by more than 2, and us thi fact to bound the number of rectangl in b(vj+1, vj ). let p0 (v ) and p1 (v ) be the expect payoff to v when it plai 0 and 1, respect. both p0 (v ) and p1 (v ) ar multilinear function of the strategi of v "s neighbor. in what follow, we will frequent us the follow simpl observ. claim 1. for a vertex v with a singl child u and parent w , given ani a, b, c, d ∈ q, a , b , c , d ∈ q, on can select the payoff to v so that p0 (v ) = auw + bu + cw + d, p1 (v ) = a uw + b u + c w + d . moreov, if all a, b, c, d, a , b , c , d ar integ, the payoff to v ar integ as well. proof. we will give the proof for p0 (v ); the proof for p1 (v ) is similar. for i, j = 0, 1, let pij be the payoff to v when u plai i, v plai 0 and w plai j. we have p0 (v ) = p00(1 − u)(1 − w) + p10u(1 − w) + p01(1 − u)w + p11uw. we have to select the valu of pij so that p00 − p10 − p01 + p11 = a, −p00 + p10 = b, −p00 + p01 = c, p00 = d. it is easi to see that the uniqu solut is given by p00 = d, p01 = c + d, p10 = b + d, p11 = a + b + c + d. the input to all algorithm consid in thi paper includ the payoff matric for each player. we assum that all element of these matric ar integ. let pmax be the greatest absolut valu of ani element of ani payoff matrix. then the input consist of at most n2Δ+1 number, each of which can be repres us log pmax bit. 3. nash equilibria that maxim the social welfar: solut in r \ q from the point of view of social welfar, the best nash  equilibrium is the on that maxim the sum of the player" expect payoff. unfortun, it turn out that comput such a strategi profil exactli is not possibl: in thi section, we show that even if all player" payoff ar integ, the strategi profil that maxim the total payoff mai have irrat coordin; moreov, it mai involv algebra number of an arbitrari degre. 3.1 warm-up: quadrat irration we start by provid an exampl of a graphic game on a path of length 3 with integ payoff such that in the nash equilibrium that maxim the total payoff, on of the player ha a strategi in r \ q. in the next subsect, we will extend thi exampl to  algebra number of arbitrari degre n; to do so, we have to consid path of length o(n). theorem 1. there exist an integ-payoff graphic game g on a 3-vertex path uv w such that, in ani nash equilibrium of g that maxim social welfar, the strategi, u, of the player u and the total payoff, p, satisfi u, p ∈ r \ q. proof. the payoff to the player in g ar specifi as follow. the payoff to u is ident 0, i.e., p0 (u) = p1 (u) = 0. us claim 1, we select the payoff to v so that p0 (v ) = −uw + 3w and p1 (v ) = p0 (v ) + w(u + 2) − (u + 1), where u and w ar the (mix) strategi of u and w , respect. it follow that v is indiffer between plai 0 and 1 if and onli if w = f(u) = u+1 u+2 . observ that for ani u ∈ [0, 1] we have f(u) ∈ [0, 1]. the payoff to w is 0 if it select the same action as v and 1 otherwis. claim 2. all nash equilibria of the game g ar of the form (u, 1/2, f(u)). that is, in ani nash equilibrium, v plai v = 1/2 and w plai w = f(u). moreov, for ani valu of u, the vector of strategi (u, 1/2, f(u)) constitut a nash equilibrium. proof. it is easi to check that for ani u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a nash equilibrium. inde, u is content to plai 164 ani mix strategi u no matter what v and w do. furthermor, v is indiffer between 0 and 1 as long as w = f(u), so it can plai 1/2. final, if v plai 0 and 1 with equal probabl, w is indiffer between 0 and 1, so it can plai f(u). convers, suppos that v > 1/2. then w strictli prefer to plai 0, i.e., w = 0. then for v we have p1 (v ) = p0 (v ) − (u + 1), i.e., p1 (v ) < p0 (v ), which impli v = 0, a contradict. similarli, if v < 1/2, player w prefer to plai 1, so we have w = 1. henc, p1 (v ) = p0 (v ) + (u + 2) − (u + 1), i.e., p1 (v ) > p0 (v ), which impli v = 1, a contradict. final, if v = 1/2, but w = f(u), player v is not indiffer between 0 and 1, so he would deviat from plai 1/2. thi complet the proof of claim 2. by claim 2, the total payoff in ani nash equilibrium of thi game is a function of u. more specif, the payoff to u is 0, the payoff to v is −uf(u) + 3f(u), and the payoff to w is 1/2. therefor, the nash equilibrium with the maximum total payoff correspond to the valu of u that maxim g(u) = −u (u + 1) u + 2 + 3 u + 1 u + 2 = − (u − 3)(u + 1) u + 2 . to find extrema of g(u), we comput h(u) = − d du g(u). we have h(u) = (2u − 2)(u + 2) − (u − 3)(u + 1) (u + 2)2 = u2 + 4u − 1 (u + 2)2 . henc, h(u) = 0 if and onli if u ∈ {−2 + √ 5, −2 − √ 5}. note that −2 + √ 5 ∈ [0, 1]. the function g(u) chang sign at −2, −1, and 3. we have g(u) < 0 for g > 3, g(u) > 0 for u < −2, so the extremum of g(u) that li between 1 and 3, i.e., u = −2 + √ 5, is a local maximum. we conclud that the social welfar-maxim nash equilibrium for thi game is given by the vector of strategi (−2+√ 5, 1/2, (5 − √ 5)/5). the respect total payoff is 0 − ( √ 5 − 5)( √ 5 − 1) √ 5 + 1 2 = 13/2 − 2 √ 5. thi conclud the proof of theorem 1. 3.2 strategi of arbitrari degre we have shown that in the social welfar-maxim nash  equilibrium, some player" strategi can be quadrat irration, and so can the total payoff. in thi subsect, we will extend thi result to show that we can construct an integ-payoff graphic game on a path whose social welfar-maxim nash equilibrium involv arbitrari algebra number in [0, 1]. theorem 2. for ani degre-n algebra number α ∈ [0, 1], there exist an integ payoff graphic game on a path of length o(n) such that, in all social welfar-maxim nash equilibria of thi game, on of the player plai α. proof. our proof consist of two step. first, we construct a ration express r(x) and a segment [x , x ] such that x , x ∈ q and α is the onli maximum of r(x) on [x , x ]. second, we construct a graphic game whose nash equilibria can be  parameter by u ∈ [x , x ], so that at the equilibrium that correspond to u the total payoff is r(u) and, moreov, some player"s  strategi is u. it follow that to achiev the payoff-maxim nash equilibrium, thi player ha to plai α. the detail follow. lemma 1. given an algebra number α ∈ [0, 1], deg(α) = n, there exist k2, . . . , k2n+2 ∈ q and x , x ∈ (0, 1) ∩ q such that α is the onli maximum of r(x) = k2 x + 2 + · · · + k2n+2 x + 2n + 2 on [x , x ]. proof. let p(x) be the minim polynomi of α, i.e., a  polynomi of degre n with ration coeffici whose lead  coeffici is 1 such that p(α) = 0. let a = {α1, . . . , αn} be the set of all root of p(x). consid the polynomi q1(x) = −p2 (x). it ha the same root as p(x), and moreov, for ani x ∈ a we have q1(x) < 0. henc, a is the set of all maxima of q1(x). now, set r(x) = q1(x) (x+2)...(x+2n+1)(x+2n+2) . observ that r(x) ≤ 0 for all x ∈ [0, 1] and r(x) = 0 if and onli if q1(x) = 0. henc, the set a is also the set of all maxima of r(x) on [0, 1]. let d = min{|αi − α| | αi ∈ a, αi = α}, and set α = max{α − d/2, 0}, α = min{α + d/2, 1}. clearli, α is the onli zero (and henc, the onli maximum) of r(x) on [α , α ]. let x and x be some ration number in (α , α) and (α, α ), respect; note that by exclud the endpoint of the interv we ensur that x , x = 0, 1. as [x , x ] ⊂ [α , α ], we have that α is the onli maximum of r(x) on [x , x ]. as r(x) is a proper ration express and all root of it  denomin ar simpl, by partial fraction decomposit theorem, r(x) can be repres as r(x) = k2 x + 2 + · · · + k2n+2 x + 2n + 2 , where k2, . . . , k2n+2 ar ration number. consid a graphic game on the path u−1v−1u0v0u1v1 . . . uk−1vk−1uk, where k = 2n + 2. intuit, we want each tripl (ui−1, vi−1, ui) to behav similarli to the player u, v , and w from the game describ in the previou subsect. more precis, we defin the payoff to the player in the follow wai. • the payoff to u−1 is 0 no matter what everyon els doe. • the expect payoff to v−1 is 0 if it plai 0 and u0 − (x − x )u−1 −x if it plai 1, where u0 and u−1 ar the strategi of u0 and u−1, respect. • the expect payoff to v0 is 0 if it plai 0 and u1(u0 + 1)− u0 if it plai 1, where u0 and u1 ar the strategi of u0 and u1, respect. • for each i = 1, . . . , k − 1, the expect payoff to vi when it plai 0 is p0 (vi) = aiuiui+1 − aiui+1, and the  expect payoff to vi when it plai 1 is p1 (vi) = p0 (vi) + ui+1(2 − ui) − 1, where ai = −ki+1 and ui+1 and ui ar the strategi of ui+1 and ui, respect. • for each i = 0, . . . , k, the payoff to ui doe not depend on vi and is 1 if ui and vi−1 select differ action and 0 otherwis. we will now character the nash equilibria of thi game us a sequenc of claim. claim 3. in all nash equilibria of thi game v−1 plai 1/2, and the strategi of u−1 and u0 satisfi u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x . consequ, in all nash equilibria we have u0 ∈ [x , x ]. 165 proof. the proof is similar to that of claim 2. let f(u−1) = (x − x )u−1 + x . clearli, the player v−1 is indiffer between plai 0 and 1 if and onli if u0 = f(u−1). suppos that v−1 < 1/2. then u0 strictli prefer to plai 1, i.e., u0 = 1, so we have p1 (v−1) = p0 (v−1) + 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x . as 1 − x ≤ 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x ≤ 1 − x for u−1 ∈ [0, 1] and x < 1, we have p1 (v−1) > p0 (v−1), so v−1 prefer to plai 1, a contradict. similarli, if v−1 > 1/2, the player u0 strictli prefer to plai 0, i.e., u0 = 0, so we have p1 (v−1) = p0 (v−1) − (x − x )u−1 − x . as x < x , x > 0, we have p1 (v−1) < p0 (v−1), so v−1 prefer to plai 0, a contradict. final, if v−1 plai 1/2, but u0 = f(u−1), player v−1 is not indiffer between 0 and 1, so he would deviat from plai 1/2. also, note that f(0) = x , f(1) = x , and, moreov, f(u−1) ∈ [x , x ] if and onli if u−1 ∈ [0, 1]. henc, in all nash equilibria of thi game we have u0 ∈ [x , x ]. claim 4. in all nash equilibria of thi game for each i = 0, . . . , k − 1, we have vi = 1/2, and the strategi of the  player ui and ui+1 satisfi ui+1 = fi(ui), where f0(u) = u/(u + 1) and fi(u) = 1/(2 − u) for i > 0. proof. the proof of thi claim is also similar to that of claim 2. we us induct on i to prove that the statement of the claim is true and, addition, ui = 1 for i > 0. for the base case i = 0, note that u0 = 0 by the previou claim (recal that x , x ar select so that x , x = 0, 1) and consid the tripl (u0, v0, u1). let v0 be the strategi of v0. first, suppos that v0 > 1/2. then u1 strictli prefer to plai 0, i.e., u1 = 0. then for v0 we have p1 (v0) = p0 (v0) − u0. as u0 = 0, we have p1 (v0) < p0 (v0), which impli v1 = 0, a contradict. similarli, if v0 < 1/2, player u1 prefer to plai 1, so we have u1 = 1. henc, p1 (v0) = p0 (v0) + 1. it follow that p1 (v0) > p0 (v0), which impli v0 = 1, a contradict. final, if v0 = 1/2, but u1 = u0/(u0 + 1), player v0 is not indiffer between 0 and 1, so he would deviat from plai 1/2. moreov, as u1 = u0/(u0 + 1) and u0 ∈ [0, 1], we have u1 = 1. the argument for the induct step is similar. name, suppos that the statement is prove for all i < i and consid the tripl (ui, vi, ui+1). let vi be the strategi of vi. first, suppos that vi > 1/2. then ui+1 strictli prefer to plai 0, i.e., ui+1 = 0. then for vi we have p1 (vi) = p0 (vi)−1, i.e., p1 (vi) < p0 (vi), which impli vi = 0, a contradict. similarli, if vi < 1/2, player ui+1 prefer to plai 1, so we have ui+1 = 1. henc, p1 (vi) = p0 (vi) + 1 − ui. by induct hypothesi, we have ui < 1. consequ, p1 (vi) > p0 (vi), which impli vi = 1, a contradict. final, if vi = 1/2, but ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui), player vi is not indiffer between 0 and 1, so he would deviat from plai 1/2. moreov, as ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) and ui < 1, we have ui+1 < 1. claim 5. ani strategi profil of the form (u−1, 1/2, u0, 1/2, u1, 1/2, . . . , uk−1, 1/2, uk), where u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x , u1 = u0/(u0 + 1), and ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) for i ≥ 1 constitut a nash equilibrium. proof. first, the player u−1"s payoff do not depend on other player" action, so he is free to plai ani strategi in [0, 1]. as long as u0 = (x −x )u−1 +x , player v−1 is indiffer between 0 and 1, so he is content to plai 1/2; a similar argument appli to player v0, . . . , vk−1. final, for each i = 0, . . . , k, the payoff of player ui onli depend on the strategi of player vi−1. in particular, as long as vi−1 = 1/2, player ui is indiffer between plai 0 and 1, so he can plai ani mix strategi ui ∈ [0, 1]. to complet the proof, note that (x − x )u−1 + x ∈ [0, 1] for all u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0/(u0 + 1) ∈ [0, 1] for all u0 ∈ [0, 1], and 1/(2 − ui) ∈ [0, 1] for all ui ∈ [0, 1], so we have ui ∈ [0, 1] for all i = 0, . . . , k. now, let us comput the total payoff under a strategi profil of the form given in claim 5. the payoff to u−1 is 0, and the  expect payoff to each of the ui, i = 0, . . . , k, is 1/2. the expect payoff to v−1 and v0 ar 0. final, for ani i = 1, . . . , k − 1, the expect payoff to vi is ti = aiuiui+1 − aiui+1. it  follow that to find a nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maxim pk−1 i=1 ti subject to condit u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. we would like to express pk−1 i=1 ti as a function of u0. to  simplifi notat, set u = u0. lemma 2. for i = 1, . . . , k, we have ui = u+i−1 u+i . proof. the proof is by induct on i. for i = 1, we have u1 = u/(u + 1). now, for i ≥ 2 suppos that ui−1 = (u + i − 2)/(u + i − 1). we have ui = 1/(2 − ui−1) = (u + i − 1)/(2u + 2i − 2 − u − i + 2) = (u + i − 1)/(u + i). it follow that for i = 1, . . . , k − 1 we have ti = ai u + i − 1 u + i u + i u + i + 1 − ai u + i u + i + 1 = −ai 1 u + i + 1 = ki+1 u + i + 1 . observ that as u−1 vari from 0 to 1, u vari from x to x . therefor, to maxim the total payoff, we have to choos u ∈ [x , x ] so as to maxim k2 u + 2 + · · · + kk u + k = r(u). by construct, the onli maximum of r(u) on [x , x ] is α. it  follow that in the payoff-maxim nash equilibrium of our game u0 plai α. final, note that the payoff in our game ar ration rather than integ. howev, it is easi to see that we can multipli all payoff to a player by their greatest common denomin without affect hi strategi. in the result game, all payoff ar integ. thi conclud the proof of theorem 2. 4. approxim the social  optim nash equilibrium we have seen that the nash equilibrium that maxim the  social welfar mai involv strategi that ar not in q. henc, in thi section we focu on find a nash equilibrium that is almost  optim from the social welfar perspect. we propos an algorithm that for ani > 0 find a nash equilibrium whose total payoff is within from optim. the run time of thi algorithm is polynomi in 1/ , n and |pmax| (recal that pmax is the maximum absolut valu of an entri of a payoff matrix). while the neg result of the previou section is for graphic game on path, our algorithm appli to a wider rang of  scenario. name, it run in polynomi time on bound-degre tree 166 as long as the best respons polici of each vertex, given it parent, can be repres as a union of a polynomi number of  rectangl. note that path graph alwai satisfi thi condit: in [9] we show how to comput such a represent, given a graph with maximum degre 2. consequ, for path graph the run time of our algorithm is guarante to be polynomi. (note that [9] exhibit a famili of graphic game on bound-degre tree for which the best respons polici of some of the vertic, given their parent, have exponenti size, when repres as union of  rectangl.) due to space restrict, in thi version of the paper we present the algorithm for the case where the graph underli the graphic game is a path. we then state our result for the gener case; the proof can be found in the full version of thi paper [10]. suppos that s is a strategi profil for a graphic game g. that is, s assign a mix strategi to each vertex of g. let epv (s) be the expect payoff of player v under s and let ep(s) =p v epv (s). let m(g) = max{ep(s) | s is a nash equilibrium for g}. theorem 3. suppos that g is a graphic game on an  nvertex path. then for ani > 0 there is an algorithm that  construct a nash equilibrium s for g that satisfi ep(s ) ≥ m(g)− . the run time of the algorithm is o(n4 p3 max/ 3 ) proof. let {v1, . . . , vn} be the set of all player. we start by construct the best respons polici for all vi, i = 1, . . . , n − 1. as shown in [9], thi can be done in time o(n3 ). let n > 5n be a paramet to be select later, set δ = 1/n, and defin x = {jδ | j = 0, . . . , n}. we sai that vj is an event point for a player vi if it is a vi-event point for b(vi, vi−1) or b(vi+1, vi). for each player vi, consid a finit set of strategi xi given by xi = x ∪ {vj |vj is an event point for vi}. it ha been shown in [9] that for ani i = 2, . . . , n, the best respons polici b(vi, vi−1) ha at most 2n + 4 vi-event point. as we requir n > 5n, we have |xi| ≤ 2n; assum without loss of gener that |xi| = 2n. order the element of xi in increas order as x1 i = 0 < x2 i < · · · < x2n i . we will refer to the strategi in xi as discret strategi of player vi; a strategi profil in which each player ha a discret strategi will be refer to as a discret strategi profil. we will now show that even we restrict each player vi to  strategi from xi, the player can still achiev a nash equilibrium, and moreov, the best such nash equilibrium (with respect to the  social welfar) ha total payoff at least m(g) − as long as n is larg enough. let s be a strategi profil that maxim social welfar. that is, let s = (s1, . . . , sn) where si is the mix strategi of player vi and ep(s) = m(g). for i = 1, . . . , n, let ti = max{xj i | xj i ≤ si}. first, we will show that the strategi profil t = (t1, . . . , tn) is a nash equilibrium for g. fix ani i, 1 < i ≤ n, and let r = [v1, v2]×[u1, u2] be the  rectangl in b(vi, vi−1) that contain (si, si−1). as v1 is a vi-event point of b(vi, vi−1), we have v1 ≤ ti, so the point (ti, si−1) is  insid r. similarli, the point u1 is a vi−1-event point of b(vi, vi−1), so we have u1 ≤ ti−1, and therefor the point (ti, ti−1) is insid r. thi mean that for ani i, 1 < i ≤ n, we have ti−1 ∈ pbrvi−1 (ti), which impli that t = (t1, . . . , tn) is a nash equilibrium for g. now, let us estim the expect loss in social welfar caus by plai t instead of s. lemma 3. for ani pair of strategi profil t, s such that |ti − si| ≤ δ we have |epvi (s) − epvi (t)| ≤ 24pmaxδ for ani i = 1, . . . , n. proof. let pi klm be the payoff of the player vi, when he plai k, vi−1 plai l, and vi+1 plai m. fix i = 1, . . . , n and for k, l, m ∈ {0, 1}, set tklm = tk i−1(1 − ti−1)1−k tl i(1 − ti)1−l tm i+1(1 − ti+1)1−m sklm = sk i−1(1 − si−1)1−k sl i(1 − si)1−l sm i+1(1 − si+1)1−m . we have |epvi (s) − epvi (t)| ≤ x k,l,m=0,1 |pi klm(tklm − sklm )| ≤ 8pmax max klm |tklm − sklm | we will now show that for ani k, l, m ∈ {0, 1} we have |tklm − sklm | ≤ 3δ; clearli, thi impli the lemma. inde, fix k, l, m ∈ {0, 1}. set x = tk i−1(1 − ti−1)1−k , x = sk i−1(1 − si−1)1−k , y = tl i(1 − ti)1−l , y = sl i(1 − si)1−l , z = tm i+1(1 − ti+1)1−m , z = sm i+1(1 − si+1)1−m . observ that if k = 0 then x − x = (1 − ti−1) − (1 − si−1), and if k = 1 then x − x = ti−1 − si−1, so |x − x | ≤ δ. a similar argument show |y − y | ≤ δ, |z − z | ≤ δ. also, we have x, x , y, y , z, z ∈ [0, 1]. henc, |tklm −sklm | = |xyz−x y z | = |xyz − x yz + x yz − x y z + x y z − x y z | ≤ |x − x |yz + |y − y |x z + |z − z |x y ≤ 3δ. lemma 3 impli pn i=1 |epvi (s) − epvi (t)| ≤ 24npmaxδ, so by choos δ < /(24npmax), or, equival, set n > 24npmax/ , we can ensur that the total expect payoff for the strategi profil t is within from optim. we will now show that we can find the best discret nash  equilibrium (with respect to the social welfar) us dynam  program. as t is a discret strategi profil, thi mean that the strategi profil found by our algorithm will be at least as good as t. defin ml,k i to be the maximum total payoff that v1, . . . , vi−1 can achiev if each vj , j ≤ i, choos a strategi from xj , for each j < i the strategi of vj is a potenti best respons to the strategi of vj+1, and, moreov, vi−1 plai xl i−1, vi plai xk i . if there is no wai to choos the strategi for v1, . . . , vi−1 to satisfi these condit, we set ml,k i = −∞. the valu ml,k i , i = 1, . . . , n; k, l = 1, . . . , n, can be comput induct, as follow. we have ml,k 1 = 0 for k, l = 1, . . . , n. now, suppos that we have alreadi comput ml,k j for all j < i; k, l = 1, . . . , n. to comput mk,l i , we first check if (xk i , xl i−1) ∈ b(vi, vi−1). if thi is not the case, we have ml,k i = −∞. otherwis, consid the set y = xi−2 ∩ pbrvi−2 (xl i−1), i.e., the set of all discret strategi of vi−2 that ar potenti best respons to xl i−1. the proof of theorem 1 in [9] impli that the set pbrvi−2 (xl i−1) is non-empti: the player vi−2 ha a potenti best respons to ani strategi of vi−1, in particular, xl i−1. by construct of the set xi−2, thi impli that y is not empti. for each xj i−2 ∈ y , let pjlk be the payoff that vi−1 receiv when vi−2 plai xj i−2, vi−1 plai xl i−1, and vi plai xk i . clearli, pjlk can be comput in constant time. then we have ml,k i = max{mj,l i−1 + pjlk | xj i−2 ∈ y }. final, suppos that we have comput ml,k n for l, k = 1, . . . , n. we still need to take into account the payoff of player vn. henc, 167 we consid all pair (xk n, xl n−1) that satisfi xl n−1 ∈ pbrvn−1 (xk n), and pick the on that maxim the sum of mk,l n and the payoff of vn when he plai xk n and vn−1 plai xl n−1. thi result in the maximum total payoff the player can achiev in a nash  equilibrium us discret strategi; the actual strategi profil that  produc thi payoff can be reconstruct us standard dynam  program techniqu. it is easi to see that each ml,k i can be comput in time o(n), i.e., all of them can be comput in time o(nn3 ). recal that we have to select n ≥ (24npmax)/ to ensur that the strategi profil we output ha total payoff that is within from optim. we conclud that we can comput an -approxim to the best nash equilibrium in time o(n4 p3 max/ 3 ). thi complet the proof of theorem 3. to state our result for the gener case (i.e., when the underli graph is a bound-degre tree rather than a path), we need  addit notat. if g ha n player, let q(n) be an upper bound on the number of event point in the represent of ani best respons polici. that is, we assum that for ani vertex u with parent v , b(v, u) ha at most q(n) event point. we will be  interest in the situat in which q(n) is polynomi in n. theorem 4. let g be an n-player graphic game on a tree in which each node ha at most Δ children. suppos we ar given a set of best-respons polici for g in which each best-respons  polici b(v, u) is repres by a set of rectangl with at most q(n) event point. for ani > 0, there is an algorithm that construct a nash equilibrium s for g that satisfi ep(s ) ≥ m(g) − . the run time of the algorithm is polynomi in n, pmax and −1 provid that the tree ha bound degre (that is, Δ = o(1)) and q(n) is a polynomi in n. in particular, if n = max((Δ + 1)q(n) + 1, n2Δ+2 (Δ + 2)pmax −1 ) and Δ > 1 then the run time is o(nΔ(2n)Δ . for the proof of thi theorem, see [10]. 4.1 a polynomi-time algorithm for  multipl approxim the run time of our algorithm is pseudopolynomi rather than polynomi, becaus it includ a factor which is polynomi in pmax, the maximum (in absolut valu) entri in ani payoff  matrix. if we ar interest in multipl approxim rather than addit on, thi can be improv to polynomi. first, note that we cannot expect a multipl  approxim for all input. that is, we cannot hope to have an algorithm that comput a nash equilibrium with total payoff at least (1 − )m(g). if we had such an algorithm, then for graphic game g with m(g) = 0, the algorithm would be requir to output the optim solut. to show that thi is infeas, observ that we can us the techniqu of section 3.2 to construct two  integercoeffici graphic game on path of length o(n) such that for some x ∈ r the maxim total payoff in the first game is x, the maxim total payoff in the second game is −x, and for both game, the strategi profil that achiev the maxim total payoff involv algebra number of degre n. by combin the two game so that the first vertex of the second game becom  connect to the last vertex of the first game, but the payoff of all player do not chang, we obtain a graphic game in which the best nash equilibrium ha total payoff 0, yet the strategi that lead to thi payoff have high algebra complex. howev, we can achiev a multipl approxim when all entri of the payoff matric ar posit and the ratio between ani two entri is polynomi bound. recal that we assum that all payoff ar integ, and let pmin > 0 be the smallest entri of ani payoff matrix. in thi case, for ani strategi profil the payoff to player i is at least pmin, so the total payoff in the social-welfar maxim nash equilibrium s satisfi m(g) ≥ npmin.  moreov, lemma 3 impli that by choos δ < /(24pmax/pmin), we can ensur that the nash equilibrium t produc by our  algorithm satisfi nx i=1 epvi (s) − nx i=1 epvi (t) ≤ 24pmaxδn ≤ npmin ≤ m(g), i.e., for thi valu of δ we have pn i=1 epvi (t) ≥ (1 − )m(g). recal that the run time of our algorithm is o(nn3 ), where n ha to be select to satisfi n > 5n, n = 1/δ. it follow that if pmin > 0, pmax/pmin = poli(n), we can choos n so that our algorithm provid a multipl approxim guarante and run in time polynomi in n and 1/ . 5. bound payoff nash equilibria anoth natur wai to defin what is a good nash equilibrium is to requir that each player"s expect payoff exce a certain threshold. these threshold do not have to be the same for all  player. in thi case, in addit to the payoff matric of the n player, we ar given n number t1, . . . , tn, and our goal is to find a nash equilibrium in which the payoff of player i is at least ti, or report that no such nash equilibrium exist. it turn out that we can  design an fpta for thi problem us the same techniqu as in the previou section. theorem 5. given a graphic game g on an n-vertex path and n ration number t1, . . . , tn, suppos that there exist a strategi profil s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and epvi (s) ≥ ti for i = 1, . . . , n. then for ani > 0 we can find in time o(max{np3 max/ 3 , n4 / 3 }) a strategi profil s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and epvi (s ) ≥ ti − for i = 1, . . . , n. proof. the proof is similar to that of theorem 3. first, we construct the best respons polici for all player, choos n > 5n, and construct the set xi, i = 1, . . . , n, as describ in the proof of theorem 3. consid a strategi profil s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and epvi (s) ≥ ti for i = 1, . . . , n. we construct a  strategi profil ti = max{xj i | xj i ≤ si} and us the same  argument as in the proof of theorem 3 to show that t is a nash  equilibrium for g. by lemma 3, we have |epvi (s) − epvi (t)| ≤ 24pmaxδ, so choos δ < /(24pmax), or, equival, n > max{5n, 24pmax/ }, we can ensur epvi (t) ≥ ti − for i = 1, . . . , n. now, we will us dynam program to find a discret nash equilibrium that satisfi epvi (t) ≥ ti − for i = 1, . . . , n. as t is a discret strategi profil, our algorithm will succe whenev there is a strategi profil s with epvi (s) ≥ ti− for i = 1, . . . , n. let zl,k i = 1 if there is a discret strategi profil such that for ani j < i the strategi of the player vj is a potenti best respons to the strategi of vj+1, the expect payoff of vj is at least tj − , and, moreov, vi−1 plai xl i−1, vi plai xk i . otherwis, let zl,k i = 0. we can comput zl,k i , i = 1, . . . , n; k, l = 1, . . . , n induct, as follow. we have zl,k 1 = 1 for k, l = 1, . . . , n. now, suppos that we have alreadi comput zl,k j for all j < i; k, l = 1, . . . , n. to comput zk,l i , we first check if (xk i , xl i−1) ∈ b(vi, vi−1). if thi 168 is not the case, clearli, zk,l i = 0. otherwis, consid the set y = xi−2 ∩pbrvi−2 (xl i−1), i.e., the set of all discret strategi of vi−2 that ar potenti best respons to xl i−1. it ha been shown in the proof of theorem 3 that y = ∅. for each xj i−2 ∈ y , let pjlk be the payoff that vi−1 receiv when vi−2 plai xj i−2, vi−1 plai xl i−1, and vi plai xk i . clearli, pjlk can be comput in constant time. if there exist an xj i−2 ∈ y such that zj,l i−1 = 1 and pjlk ≥ ti−2 − , set zl,k i = 1. otherwis, set zl,k i = 0. have comput zl,k n , l, k = 1, . . . , n, we check if zl,k n = 1 for some pair (l, k). if such a pair of indic exist, we  instruct vn to plai xk n and us dynam program techniqu (or, equival, the downstream pass of the algorithm of [13]) to find a nash equilibrium s that satisfi epvi (s ) ≥ ti − for i = 1, . . . , n (recal that vn is a dummi player, i.e., we assum tn = 0, epn(s ) = 0 for ani choic of s ). if zl,k n = 0 for all l, k = 1, . . . , n, there is no discret nash equilibrium s that  satisfi epvi (s ) ≥ ti − for i = 1, . . . , n and henc no nash equilibrium s (not necessarili discret) such that epvi (s) ≥ ti for i = 1, . . . , n. the run time analysi is similar to that for theorem 3; we conclud that the run time of our algorithm is o(nn3 ) = o(max{np3 max/ 3 , n4 / 3 }). remark 1. theorem 5 can be extend to tree of bound degre in the same wai as theorem 4. 5.1 exact comput anoth approach to find nash equilibria with bound  payoff is base on induct comput the subset of the best  respons polici of all player so as to exclud the point that do not provid suffici payoff to some of the player. formal, we sai that a strategi v of the player v is a potenti best respons to a strategi w of it parent w with respect to a threshold vector t = (t1, . . . , tn), (denot by v ∈ pbrv (w, t)) if there is an equilibrium in the instanc g(v,w ),w =w in which v plai mix strategi v and the payoff to ani player vi downstream of v  (includ v ) is at least ti. the best respons polici for v with respect to a threshold vector t is defin as b(w, v, t) = {(w, v) | v ∈ pbrv (w, t), w ∈ [0, 1]}. it is easi to see that if ani of the set b(vj, vj−1, t), j = 1, . . . , n, is empti, it mean that it is imposs to provid all player with expect payoff prescrib by t. otherwis, on can appli the downstream pass of the origin algorithm of [13] to find a nash equilibrium. as we assum that vn is a dummi  vertex whose payoff is ident 0, the nash equilibrium with these payoff exist as long as tn ≤ 0 and b(vn, vn−1, t) is not empti. us the techniqu develop in [9], it is not hard to show that for ani j = 1, . . . , n, the set b(vj , vj−1, t) consist of a finit number of rectangl, and on can comput b(vj+1, vj , t) given b(vj , vj−1, t). the advantag of thi approach is that it allow us to repres all nash equilibria that provid requir payoff to the player. howev, it is not like to be practic, sinc it turn out that the rectangl that appear in the represent of b(vj , vj−1, t) mai have irrat coordin. claim 6. there exist a graphic game g on a 3-vertex path uv w and a vector t = (t1, t2, t3) such that b(v, w, t)  cannot be repres as a union of a finit number of rectangl with ration coordin. proof. we defin the payoff to the player in g as follow. the payoff to u is ident 0, i.e., p0 (u) = p1 (u) = 0.  us claim 1, we select the payoff to v so that p0 (v ) = uw, p1 (v ) = p0 (v ) + w − .8u − .1, where u and w ar the (mix) strategi of u and w , respect. it follow that v is indiffer between plai 0 and 1 if and onli if w = f(u) = .8u + .1; observ that for ani u ∈ [0, 1] we have f(u) ∈ [0, 1]. it is not hard to see that we have b(w, v ) = [0, .1]×{0} ∪ [.1, .9]×[0, 1] ∪ [.9, 1]×{1}. the payoff to w ar not import for our construct; for  exampl, set p0(w ) = p0(w ) = 0. now, set t = (0, 1/8, 0), i.e., we ar interest in nash  equilibria in which v "s expect payoff is at least 1/8. suppos w ∈ [0, 1]. the player v can plai a mix strategi v when w is  plai w as long as u plai u = f−1 (w) = 5w/4 − 1/8 (to ensur that v is indiffer between 0 and 1) and p0 (v ) = p1 (v ) = uw = w(5w/4 − 1/8) ≥ 1/8. the latter condit is satisfi if w ≤ (1 − √ 41)/20 < 0 or w ≥ (1 + √ 41)/20. note that we have .1 < (1 + √ 41)/20 < .9. for ani other valu of w, ani strategi of u either make v prefer on of the pure strategi or doe not provid it with a suffici expect payoff. there ar also some valu of w for which v can plai a pure strategi (0 or 1) as a potenti best respons to w and guarante itself an expect payoff of at least 1/8; it can be shown that these valu of w form a finit number of segment in [0, 1]. we conclud that ani  represent of b(w, v, t) as a union of a finit number of rectangl must contain a rectangl of the form [(1 + √ 41)/20, w ]×[v , v ] for some w , v , v ∈ [0, 1]. on the other hand, it can be shown that for ani integ payoff matric and threshold vector and ani j = 1, . . . , n − 1, the set b(vj+1, vj, t) contain no rectangl of the form [u , u ]×{v} or {v}×[w , w ], where v ∈ r\q. thi mean that if b(vn, vn−1, t) is non-empti, i.e., there is a nash equilibrium with payoff  prescrib by t, then the downstream pass of the algorithm of [13] can alwai pick a strategi profil that form a nash equilibrium, provid a payoff of at least ti to the player vi, and ha no  irrat coordin. henc, unlik in the case of the nash  equilibrium that maxim the social welfar, work with irrat number is not necessari, and the fact that the algorithm discuss in thi section ha to do so can be seen as an argument against us thi approach. 6. other criteria for select a nash equilibrium in thi section, we consid sever other criteria that can be  us in select a nash equilibrium. 6.1 combin welfar maxim with bound on payoff in mani real life scenario, we want to maxim the social  welfar subject to certain restrict on the payoff to individu  player. for exampl, we mai want to ensur that no player get a neg expect payoff, or that the expect payoff to player i is at least pi max − ξ, where pi max is the maximum entri of i"s  payoff matrix and ξ is a fix paramet. formal, given a graphic game g and a vector t1, . . . , tn, let s be the set of all nash  equilibria s of g that satisfi ti ≤ epvi (s) for i = 1, . . . , n, and let ˆs = argmax∈s ep(s). if the set s is non-empti, we can find a nash equilibrium ˆs that is -close to satisfi the payoff bound and is within from ˆs with respect to the total payoff by combin the algorithm of section 4 and section 5. name, for a given > 0, choos δ as in the proof of theorem 3, and let xi be the set of all discret strategi of player vi (for a 169 formal definit, see the proof of theorem 3). combin the proof of theorem 3 and theorem 5, we can see that the strategi profil ˆt given by ˆti = max{xj i | xj i ≤ ˆsi} satisfi epvi (ˆt) ≥ ti − , |ep(ˆs) − ep(ˆt)| ≤ . defin ˆml,k i to be the maximum total payoff that v1, . . . , vi−1 can achiev if each vj, j ≤ i, choos a strategi from xj , for each j < i the strategi of vj is a potenti best respons to the strategi of vj+1 and the payoff to player vj is at least tj − , and,  moreov, vi−1 plai xl i−1, vi plai xk i . if there is no wai to choos the strategi for v1, . . . , vi−1 to satisfi these condit, we set ml,k i = −∞. the ˆml,k i can be comput by dynam  program similarli to the ml,k i and zl,k i in the proof of theorem 3 and 5. final, as in the proof of theorem 3, we us ml,k n to select the best discret nash equilibrium subject to the payoff constraint. even more gener, we mai want to maxim the total payoff to a subset of player (who ar assum to be abl to redistribut the profit fairli among themselv) while guarante certain  expect payoff to (a subset of) the other player. thi problem can be handl similarli. 6.2 a minimax approach a more egalitarian measur of the qualiti of a nash equilibrium is the minim expect payoff to a player. the optim solut with respect to thi measur is a nash equilibrium in which the minim expect payoff to a player is maxim. to find an  approxim to such a nash equilibrium, we can combin the  algorithm of section 5 with binari search on the space of potenti lower bound. note that the expect payoff to ani player vi given a strategi s alwai satisfi −pmax ≤ epvi (s) ≤ pmax. for a fix > 0, we start by set t = −pmax, t = pmax, t∗ = (t + t )/2. we then run the algorithm of section 5 with t1 = · · · = tn = t∗ . if the algorithm succe in find a nash equilibrium s that satisfi epvi (s ) ≥ t∗ − for all i = 1, . . . , n, we set t = t∗ , t∗ = (t + t )/2; otherwis, we set t = t∗ , t∗ = (t + t )/2 and loop. we repeat thi process until |t − t | ≤ . it is not hard to check that for ani p ∈ r, if there is a nash equilibrium s such that mini=1,...,n epvi (s) ≥ p, then our algorithm output a nash equilibrium s that satisfi mini=1,...,n epvi (s) ≥ p−2 . the run time of our algorithm is o(max{np3 max log −1 / 3 , n4 log −1 / 3 }). 6.3 equal the payoff when the player" payoff matric ar not veri differ, it is reason to demand that the expect payoff to the player do not differ by much either. we will now show that nash equilibria in thi categori can be approxim in polynomi time as well. inde, observ that the algorithm of section 5 can be easili modifi to deal with upper bound on individu payoff rather than lower bound. moreov, we can effici comput an  approxim to a nash equilibrium that satisfi both the upper bound and the lower bound for each player. more precis,  suppos that we ar given a graphic game g, 2n ration number t1, . . . , tn, t1, . . . , tn and > 0. then if there exist a  strategi profil s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and ti ≤ epvi (s) ≤ ti for i = 1, . . . , n, we can find a strategi profil s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and ti − ≤ epvi (s ) ≤ ti + for i = 1, . . . , n. the modifi algorithm also run in time o(max{np3 max/ 3 , [4]n4 / 3 }). thi observ allow us to approxim nash equilibria in which all player" expect payoff differ by at most ξ for ani fix ξ > 0. given an > 0, we set t1 = · · · = tn = −pmax, t1 = · · · = tn = −pmax + ξ + , and run the modifi version of the algorithm of section 5. if it fail to find a solut, we  increment all ti, ti by and loop. we continu until the algorithm find a solut, or ti ≥ pmax. suppos that there exist a nash equilibrium s that satisfi |epvi (s) − epvj (s)| ≤ ξ for all i, j = 1, . . . , n. set r = mini=1,...,n epvi (s); we have r ≤ epvi (s) ≤ r + ξ for all i = 1, . . . , n. there exist a k ≥ 0 such that −pmax + (k − 1) ≤ r ≤ −pmax + k . dure the kth step of the algorithm, we set t1 = · · · = tn = −pmax +(k−1) , i.e., we have r− ≤ ti ≤ r, r + ξ ≤ ti ≤ r + ξ + . that is, the nash equilibrium s satisfi ti ≤ r ≤ epvi (s) ≤ r + ξ ≤ ti , which mean that when ti is set to −pmax + (k − 1) , our algorithm is guarante to output a nash equilibrium t that satisfi r − 2 ≤ ti − ≤ epvi (t) ≤ ti + ≤ r +ξ +2 . we conclud that whenev such a nash  equilibrium s exist, our algorithm output a nash equilibrium t that satisfi |epvi (t) − epvj (t)| ≤ ξ + 4 for all i, j = 1, . . . , n. the run time of thi algorithm is o(max{np3 max/ 4 , n4 / 4 }). note also that we can find the smallest ξ for which such a nash equilibrium exist by combin thi algorithm with binari search over the space ξ = [0, 2pmax]. thi identifi an approxim to the fairest nash equilibrium, i.e., on in which the player" expect payoff differ by the smallest possibl amount. final, note that all result in thi section can be extend to bound-degre tree. 7. conclus we have studi the problem of equilibrium select in  graphic game on bound-degre tree. we consid sever criteria for select a nash equilibrium, such as maxim the social welfar, ensur a lower bound on the expect payoff of each player, etc. first, we focus on the algebra complex of a  social welfar-maxim nash equilibrium, and prove strong  neg result for that problem. name, we show that even for graphic game on path, ani algebra number α ∈ [0, 1] mai be the onli strategi avail to some player in all social  welfaremaxim nash equilibria. thi is in sharp contrast with the fact that graphic game on tree alwai possess a nash equilibrium in which all player" strategi ar ration number. we then provid approxim algorithm for select nash equilibria with special properti. while the problem of find approxim nash equilibria for variou class of game ha  receiv a lot of attent in recent year, most of the exist work aim to find -nash equilibria that satisfi (or ar -close to  satisfi) certain properti. our approach is differ in that we insist on output an exact nash equilibrium, which is -close to  satisfi a given requir. as argu in the introduct, there ar sever reason to prefer a solut that constitut an exact nash equilibrium. our algorithm ar fulli polynomi time approxim scheme, i.e., their run time is polynomi in the invers of the  approxim paramet , though thei mai be pseudopolynomi with respect to the input size. under mild restrict on the input, thei can be modifi to be truli polynomi. thi is the strongest  posit result on can deriv for a problem whose exact solut mai be hard to repres, as is the case for mani of the problem  consid here. while we prove our result for game on a path, thei can be gener to ani tree for which the best respons polici have compact represent as union of rectangl. in the full version of the paper we describ our algorithm for the gener case. further work in thi vein could includ extens to the kind of guarante sought for nash equilibria, such as guarante total payoff for subset of player, select equilibria in which some player ar receiv significantli higher payoff than their peer, etc. at the moment howev, it is perhap more import to  inv170 tigat whether nash equilibria of graphic game can be comput in a decentr manner, in contrast to the algorithm we have  introduc here. it is natur to ask if our result or those of [9] can be gener to game with three or more action. howev, it seem that thi will make the analysi significantli more difficult. in particular, note that on can view the bound payoff game as a veri limit special case of game with three action per player. name, given a two-action game with payoff bound, consid a game in which each player vi ha a third action that guarante him a payoff of ti no matter what everyon els doe. then check if there is a nash equilibrium in which none of the player assign a  nonzero probabl to hi third action is equival to check if there exist a nash equilibrium that satisfi the payoff bound in the origin game, and section 5.1 show that find an exact solut to thi problem requir new idea. altern it mai be interest to look for similar result in the context of correl equilibria (ce), especi sinc the best ce mai have higher valu (total expect payoff) than the best ne. the ratio between these valu is call the mediat valu in [1]. it is known from [1] that the mediat valu of 2-player, 2-action game with non-neg payoff is at most 4 3 , and thei exhibit a 3-player game for which it is infinit. furthermor, a 2-player,  3action exampl from [1] also ha infinit mediat valu. 8. refer [1] i. ashlagi, d. monder and m. tenneholtz, on the valu of correl,
