among registri and lack of autonom control ha sever hinder it widespread deploy and usag. with the advent of grid comput the scalabl issu of uddi will becom a roadblock that will prevent it deploy in grid. in thi paper we present our distribut web-servic discoveri architectur, call dude (distribut uddi deploy engin). dude leverag dht (distribut hash tabl) as a rendezv mechan between multipl uddi registri. dude enabl consum to queri multipl registri, still at the same time allow organ to have autonom control over their registri.. base on preliminari prototyp on planetlab, we believ that dude

abil to monitor and discov resourc and servic on grid. thei provid the abil to queri and subscrib to resourc/servic inform. in addit, threshold trap might be requir to indic specif chang in exist condit. the state of the data need to be maintain in a soft state so that the most recent inform is alwai avail. the inform gather need to be provid to varieti of system for the purpos of either util the grid or prove summari inform. howev, the fundament problem is the need to be scalabl to handl huge amount of data from multipl sourc. the web servic commun ha address the need for servic discoveri, befor grid were anticip, via an industri standard call uddi. howev, even though uddi ha been the de facto industri standard for web-servic discoveri, impos requir of tight-replic among registri and lack of autonom control, among other thing ha sever hinder it widespread deploy and usag [7]. with the advent of grid comput the scalabl issu with uddi will becom a roadblock that will prevent it deploy in grid. thi paper tackl the scalabl issu and a wai to find servic across multipl registri in uddi by develop a distribut web servic discoveri architectur. distribut uddi function can be achiev in multipl wai and perhap us differ distribut comput infrastructur/platform (e.g., corba, dce, etc.). in thi paper we explor how distribut hash tabl (dht) technolog can be leverag to develop a scalabl distribut web servic discoveri architectur. a dht is a peer-to-peer (p2p) distribut system that form a structur overlai allow more effici rout than the underli network. thi crucial design choic is motiv by two factor. the first motiv factor is the inher simplic of the put/get abstract that dht provid, which make it easi to rapidli build applic on top of dht. we recogn that have just thi abstract mai not suffic for all distribut applic, but for the object at hand, work veri well as will becom clear later. other distribut comput platform/middlewar while provid more function have much higher overhead and complex. the second motiv factor stem from the fact that dht ar rel new tool for build distribut applic and we would like to test it potenti by appli it to the problem of distribut uddi. in the next section, we provid a brief overview of grid inform servic, uddi and it limit, which is follow by an overview of dht in section 3. section 4 describ our propos architectur with detail on us case. in section 5, we articl 2 describ our current implement, follow by our find in section 6. section 7 discuss the relat work in thi area and section 8 contain our conclud remark. 2. background 2.1 grid servic discoveri grid comput is base on standard which us web servic technolog. in the architectur present in [6], the servic discoveri function is assign to a special grid servic call registri. the implement of the web servic version of the monitor and discoveri servic (ws md), also known as the md4 compon of the globu toolkit version 4 (gt4), includ such a registri in the form of the index servic resourc and servic properti ar collect and index by thi servic. it basic function make it similar to uddi registri. to attain scalabl, index servic from differ globu contain can regist with each other in a hierarch fashion to aggreg data. thi approach for attain scalabl work best in hierarch virtual organ (vo), and expand a search to find suffici number of match involv travers the hierarchi. specif, thi approach is not a good match for system that try to exploit the converg of grid and peer-to-peer comput [5]. 2.2 uddi beyond grid comput, the problem of servic discoveri need to be address more gener in the web servic commun. again, scalabl is a major concern sinc million of buyer look for specif servic need to find all the potenti seller of the servic who can meet their need. although there ar differ wai of do thi, the web servic standard committe address thi requir through a specif call uddi (univers descript, discoveri, and integr). a uddi registri enabl a busi to enter three type of inform in a uddi registri - white page, yellow page and green page. uddi"s intent is to function as a registri for servic just as the yellow page is a registri for busi. just like in yellow page, compani regist themselv and their servic under differ categori. in uddi, white page ar a list of the busi entiti. green page repres the technic inform that is necessari to invok a given servic. thu, by brows a uddi registri, a develop should be abl to locat a servic and a compani and find out how to invok the servic. when uddi wa initi offer, it provid a lot of potenti. howev, todai we find that uddi ha not been wide deploi in the internet. in fact, the onli known us of uddi ar what ar known as privat uddi registri within an enterpris"s boundari. the reader can refer to [7] for a recent articl that discuss the shortcom of uddi and the properti of an ideal servic registri. improv of the uddi standard is continu in full forc and uddi version 3 (v3) wa recent approv as an oasi standard. howev, uddi todai ha issu that have not been address, such as scalabl and autonomi of individu registri. uddi v3 provid larger support for multi-registri environ base on portabl of kei by allow kei to be re-regist in multipl registri, the abil to link registri in variou topolog is effect enabl. howev, no norm descript of these topolog is provid in the uddi specif at thi point. the improv within uddi v3 that allow support for multi-registri environ ar signific and open the possibl for addit research around how  multiregistri environ mai be deploi. a recommend deploy scenario propos by the uddi v3.0.2 specif is to us the uddi busi registri as root registri, and it is possibl to enabl thi us our solut. 2.3 distribut hash tabl a distribut hash tabl (dht) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) distribut system that form a structur overlai allow more effici rout than the underli network. it maintain a collect of kei-valu pair on the node particip in thi graph structur. for our deploy, a kei is the hash of a keyword from a servic name or descript. there will be multipl valu for thi kei, on for each servic contain the keyword. just like ani other hash tabl data structur, it provid a simpl interfac consist of put() and get() oper. thi ha to be done with robust becaus of the transient natur of node in p2p system. the valu store in the dht can be ani object or a copi or refer to it. the dht kei ar obtain from a larg identifi space. a hash function, such as md5 or sha-1, is appli to an object name to obtain it dht kei. node in a dht ar also map into the same identifi space by appli the hash function to their identifi, such as ip address and port number, or public kei. the identifi space is assign to the node in a distribut and determinist fashion, so that rout and lookup can be perform effici. the node of a dht maintain link to some of the other node in the dht. the pattern of these link is known as the dht"s geometri. for exampl, in the bamboo dht [11], and in the pastri dht [8] on which bamboo is base, node maintain link to neighbor node and to other distant node found in a rout tabl. the rout tabl entri at row i and column j, denot ri[j], is anoth node whose identifi match it own in first i digit, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j. the rout tabl allow effici overlai rout. bamboo, like all dht, specifi algorithm to be follow when a node join the overlai network, or when a node fail or leav the network the geometri must be maintain even when thi rate is high. to attain consist rout or lookup, a dht kei must be rout to the node with the numer closest identifi. for detail of how the rout tabl ar construct and maintain, the reader is refer to [8, 11]. 3. propos architectur of dht base uddi registri hierarchi as mention earlier, we propos to build a distribut uddi system on top of a dht infrastructur. thi choic is primarili motiv by the simplic of the put/get abstract that dht provid, which is power enough for the task at hand, especi sinc we plan to valid our approach with an implement run on planetlab [9]. a secondari motiv is to understand deploy issu with dht base system. sever applic have been built as overlai us dht, such as distribut file storag, databas, publish-subscrib system and content distribut network. in our case, we ar build a dht base overlai network of uddi registri, where the dht act as a rendezv network that connect multipl registri. in the grid comput scenario, an overlai network of multipl uddi registri seem to an interest altern to the uddi public articl 2 registri current maintain by microsoft, ibm, sap and ntt. in addit, our aim is to not chang ani of the uddi interfac for client as well as publish. figur 1 highlight the propos architectur for the dht base uddi registri framework. uddi node ar replic in a uddi registri as per the current uddi standard. howev, each local registri ha a local proxi registri that mediat between the local uddi registri and the dht servic. the dht servic is the glue that connect the proxi registri togeth and facilit search across registri. figur 1: dude architectur servic inform can be dispers to sever uddi registri to promot scalabl. the proxi registri publish, perform queri and delet inform from the dispers uddi registri. howev, the scope of the queri is limit to relev registri. the dht provid inform about the relev registri. the core idea in the architectur is to popul dht node with the necessari inform from the proxi which enabl easi and ubiquit search when queri ar made. when a new servic is ad to a registri, all potenti search term ar hash by the proxi and us as dht kei to publish the servic in the dht. the valu store for thi servic uniqu identifi the servic, and includ the url of a registri and the uniqu uddi kei of the servic in that registri. similarli when queri arriv, thei ar pars and a set of search term ar identifi. these search term ar hash and the valu store with those hash valu ar retriev from the dht. note that a proxi doe not need to know all dht node; it need to know just on dht node (thi is done as part of the bootstrap process) and as describ in section 2.3, thi dht node can rout the queri as necessari to the other node on the dht overlai. we describ three usag scenario later that deal with ad a new local registri, insert a new servic, and queri for a servic. furthermor, the dht optim the uddi queri mechan. thi process becom a lookup us a uddi uniqu kei rather than a queri us a set of search paramet. thi kei and the url of the registri ar obtain by search initi in the dht. the dht queri can return multipl valu for match servic, and in each of the match registri, the proxi perform lookup oper. the servic name is us as a hash for insert the servic inform. the servic inform contain the queri url and uniqu uddi kei for the registri contain the servic. there could be multipl registri associ with a given servic. the servic inform conform to the follow schema. <xs:schema xmln:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema" elementformdefault="qualifi" attributeformdefault="unqualifi"> <xs:element name="registri"> <xs:annot> <xs:document>servic inform</xs:document> </xs:annot> <xs:complextyp> <xs:sequenc> <xs:element name="registri" maxoccur="unbound"> <xs:complextyp> <xs:sequenc> <xs:element name="name"/> <xs:element name="kei" maxoccur="unbound"/> </xs:sequenc> … </xs:schema> there can be multipl proxi uddi registri in thi architectur. the advantag of thi is to introduc distribut interact between the uddi client and registri. organ can also decid what inform is avail from the local registri by implement polici at the proxi registri. 3.1 sequenc of oper in thi section, we demonstr what the sequenc of oper should be for three crucial scenario - ad a new local registri, insert a new servic and queri a servic. other oper like delet a registri, delet a servic, etc. ar similar and for the sake of breviti ar omit here. figur 2: sequenc diagram- add new local registri add a new local uddi registri figur 2 contain a sequenc diagram illustr how a new uddi registri is ad to the network of uddi registri. the new registri regist itself with it proxi registri. the proxi registri in turn queri the new registri for all servic that it ha uddi local registri uddi local registri uddi local registri proxi registri dht base distribut proxi registri proxi registri articl 2 store in it databas and in turn regist each of those entri with the dht. figur 3: sequenc diagram - add new servic add a new servic the us case diagram depict in error! refer sourc not found. highlight how a client publish a new servic to the uddi registri. in order to interact with the registri a client ha to know how to contact it local proxi registri. it then publish a servic with the proxi registri which in turn publish the servic with the local uddi registri and receiv the uddi kei of the registri entri. then new kei-valu pair ar publish in the dht, where each kei is obtain by hash a searchabl keyword of the servic and the valu consist of the queri url of the registri and the uddi kei. figur 4: sequenc diagram - queri for a servic queri a servic figur 4 show how a client queri the uddi registri for a servic. onc again, the client need to know how to contact it local proxi registri and invok the queri servic request. the proxi registri in turn contact on of the dht node to determin dht queri us the search term. as explain earlier in the context of figur 1, multipl valu might be retriev from the dht. each valu includ the queri url of a registri, and the uniqu uddi kei of a match servic in that registri. the proxi then contact the match registri and wait for the respons of lookup oper us the correspond uddi kei. upon receiv the respons, the proxi registri collat all respons and return the aggreg set of servic to the client. we will now illustr these oper us an exampl. consid a client contact it local proxi to publish a servic call comput accessori. the proxi follow the step in figur 3 to add the servic to uddi 1 registri, and also publish two entri in the dht. the kei of these entri ar obtain by hash the word comput and accessori respect. both entri have the same valu consist of the queri url of thi registri and the uniqu uddi kei return by the registri for thi servic. next we consid anoth client publish a servic call comput repair through it proxi to uddi 2 registri. a similar process result in 2 more entri be ad to the dht. recal that our dht deploy can have multipl entri with the same kei. if we follow the step in figur 4 for a client send a queri to it proxi us the word comput, we see that the dht is queri with the hash of the word comput as kei. thi retriev the queri url and respect uddi kei of both servic mention befor in thi exampl. the proxi can then do a simpl lookup oper at both uddi 1 and 2 registri. it is clear that as the number of uddi registri and client increas, thi process of lookup at onli relev uddi registri is more scalabl that do a full search us the word comput at all uddi registri. 4. implement in thi section, we describ our implement which is current deploi on planetlab [9]. planetlab is an open, global distribut platform for develop, deploi, and access network servic. it current ha 527 machin, host by 249 site, span over 25 countri. planetlab machin ar host by research/academ institut as well as industri compani. franc telecom and hp ar two of the major industri support for planetlab. everi planetlab host machin is connect to the internet and run a common softwar packag includ a linux base oper system that support server virtual. thu the user can develop and experi with new servic under real-world condit. the advantag of us planetlab is that we can test the dude architectur under real-world condit with a larg scale geograph dispers node base. due to the avail of juddi, an open sourc uddi v2 registri (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of exist readili avail uddi v3 registri, a decis to us uddi v2 wa made. the standard of uddi v3 is recent and we intend to extend thi work to support uddi v3 and subsequ version in the futur. the proxi registri is implement by modifi the juddi sourc to enabl publish, queri and delet servic inform from a dht. furthermor, it also allow queri multipl registri and collat the respons us uddi4j [13]. for the dht implement, we us the bamboo dht code [11]. the bamboo dht allow multipl proxi registri to publish and delet servic inform from their respect uddi registri, as well as to queri for servic from all the registri. the proxi us the servic name as input to the dht"s hash articl 2 function to get the dht kei. the valu that is store in the dht us thi kei is the uri of the registri along with the uddi kei of the servic. thi ensur that when the proxi registri queri for servic with a certain name, it get back the uri and uddi kei for match entri. us these return result, the proxi can do fast lookup oper at the respect uddi registri. the uddi kei make it unnecessari to repeat the search at the uddi registri with the servic name. we have so far describ the process of exact match on servic name. howev there ar addit type of search that must be support. firstli, the search request could be case-insensit. to support that, the proxi registri ha to publish the same servic onc us the name exactli as enter in the uddi registri, and onc with the name convert to all lower-case letter. to do a case-insensit search, the proxi registri simpli ha to convert the queri string into lower-case letter. secondli, the user could queri base on the prefix of a servic name. inde, thi is the default behavior of search in uddi. in other word, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the servic name be search. to support thi effici in the dht, our proxi registri have to take prefix of the servic name of vari length and publish the uri and uddi kei multipl time, onc us each prefix. for exampl, the prefix size chosen in on deploy might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 charact. if a search for the first 12 charact of a servic name is submit, the proxi registri will queri the dht with the first 10 charact of the search string, and then refin the search result to ensur that the match extend to the 12th charact. if the search string ha less than 5 charact, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the dht cannot be of ani help, unless everi servic is publish in the dht with prefix of length 0. us thi null prefix will send a copi of everi advertis servic to the dht node to which the hash of the null prefix map. sinc thi can lead to load-imbal, a better solut might be to us the dht onli to get a list of all uddi registri, and send the search to all of them in the locat to be search. thirdli, the servic name be search can be a regular express, such as on with embed wildcard charact. for exampl, a search for garden%s should match both garden suppli and garden tool. thi will be treat similarli to the previou case as the dht ha to be queri with the longest avail prefix. the result return have to be refin to ensur that the regular express match. figur 5 show the network diagram for our implement. there ar two proxi uddi and juddi registri pair. consid a client which contact the uddi proxi on grous.hpl.hp.com. the proxi doe a lookup of the dht us the queri string or a prefix. thi involv contact on of the dht node, such as  pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serv as the gatewai to the dht for grous.hpl.hp.com, base on the latter"s configur file. the dht node mai then rout the queri to on of the other dht node which is respons for the dht kei that the queri string map to. the result of the dht lookup return to  pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which forward them to grous.hpl.hp.com. the result mai includ a few servic from each of the juddi registri. so the proxi registri perform the lookup oper at both planetlab1 and planetlab2.rdfrancetelecom.com for their respect entri list in the search result. the respons to these lookup ar collat by the proxi registri and return to the client. figur 5 network diagram 5. relat work a framework for qo-base servic discoveri in grid ha been propos in [18]. uddi, an extend uddi registri for publish and discov servic base on qo paramet, is propos in [19]. our work is complementari sinc we focu on how to feder the uddi registri and address the scalabl issu with uddi. the dude proxi can publish the servic properti support by uddi in the dht and support rang queri us techniqu propos for such queri on dht. then we can deliv the scalabl benefit of our current solut to both uddi and uddi registri. discov servic meet qo and price requir ha been studi in the context of a grid economi, so that grid schedul can us variou market model such as commod market and auction. the grid market directori [20] wa propos for thi purpos. in [12], the author present an ontolog-base matchmak. resourc and request descript ar express in rdf schema, a semant markup languag. matchmak rule ar express in tripl, a languag base on horn logic. although our current implement focus on uddi version 2, in futur we will consid semant extens to uddi, ws-discoveri [16] and other grid comput standard such as monitor and discoveri servic (md) [10]. so the simplest extens of our work could involv us the dht to do an initi syntax-base search to identifi the local registri that need to be contact. then the proxi registri can contact these registri, which do semant matchmak to identifi their match, which ar then merg at the proxi registri and return to the client. the converg of grid and p2p comput ha been explor in [5]. gridvin [2] build a logic semant overlai on top of a physic layer consist of p-grid [1], a structur overlai base on distribut search tree that us prefix-base rout and chang the overlai path as part of the network mainten protocol to adapt to load in differ part of the keyspac. a feder uddi servic [4] ha been built on top of the planetp [3] publish-subscrib system for unstructur p2p commun. the focu of thi work ha been on the manag of the feder servic. the uddi servic is treat as an applic articl 2 servic to be manag in their framework. so thei do not address the issu of scalabl in uddi, and instead us simpl replic. in [21], the author describ a uddi extens (ux) system that launch a feder queri onli if local found result ar not adequ. while the ux server is posit as an intermediari similarli to the uddi proxi describ in our dude framework, it focus more on the qo framework and doe not attempt to implement a seamless feder mechan such as our dht base approach. in [22] d2ht describ a discoveri framework built on top of dht. howev, we have chosen to us uddi on top of dht. d2ht have us (agent manag system) am/ (directori facilit) df on top of dht. 6. conclus and futur work in thi paper, we have describ a distribut architectur to support larg scale discoveri of web-servic. our architectur will enabl organ to maintain autonom control over their uddi registri and at the same time allow client to queri multipl registri simultan. the client ar oblivi to the transpar proxi approach we have adopt and get richer and more complet respons to their queri. base on initi prototyp test, we believ that dude architectur can support effect distribut of uddi registri therebi make uddi more robust and also address it scale issu. the paper ha solv the scalabl issu with uddi but doe not preclud the applic of thi approach to other servic discoveri mechan. an exampl of anoth servic discoveri mechan that could benefit from such an approach is globu toolkit"s md. furthermor, we plan to investig other aspect of grid servic discoveri that extend thi work. some of these aspect includ the abil to subscrib to resourc/servic inform, the abil to maintain soft state and the abil to provid a varieti of view for variou differ purpos. in addit, we plan to revisit the servic api for a grid servic discoveri solut leverag the avail solut and specif as well as the work present in thi paper. 7. refer [1] p-grid: a self-organ structur p2p system.
