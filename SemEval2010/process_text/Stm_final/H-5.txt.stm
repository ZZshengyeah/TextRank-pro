he or she react to the system onli when the system make a ‘ye" decis on a document, by confirm or reject that decis. a more ‘activ" altern would be to allow the user to issu multipl queri for a topic, review a rank list of candid document (or passag) per queri, and provid feedback on the rank list, thu refin their inform need and request updat rank list. the latter form of user interact ha been highli effect in standard retriev for ad-hoc queri. how to deploi such a strategi for long-last inform need in af set is an open question for research. 2. the unit for receiv a relev judgment (‘ye" or ‘no") is restrict to the document level in convent af. howev, a real user mai be will to provid more inform, fine-grain feedback via  highlight some piec of text in a retriev document as relev, instead of label the entir document as relev. effect leverag such fine-grain feedback could substanti enhanc the qualiti of an af system. for thi, we need to enabl supervis learn from label piec of text of arbitrari span instead of just allow label document. 3. system-select document ar often highli  redund. a major new event, for exampl, would be report by multipl sourc repeatedli for a while, make most of the inform content in those articl redund with each other. a convent af system would select all these redund new stori for user feedback, wast the user"s time while offer littl gain. clearli, techniqu for novelti detect can help in principl [25, 2, 22] for improv the util of the af system. howev, the effect of such techniqu at passag level to detect novelti with respect to user"s (fine-grain) feedback and to detect redund in rank list remain to be evalu us a measur of util that mimic the need of a real user. to address the abov limit of current af system, we propos and examin a new approach in thi paper, combin the strength of convent af (increment learn of topic model), multi-pass passag retriev for long-last queri condit on topic, and novelti detect for remov of redund from user interact with the system. we call the new process util-base inform distil. note that convent benchmark corpora for af  evalu, which have relev judgment at the document level and do not defin task with multipl queri, ar insuffici for evalu the new approach. therefor, we extend a benchmark corpu - the tdt4 collect of new stori and tv broadcast - with task definit, multipl queri per task, and answer kei per queri. we have conduct our experi on thi extend tdt4 corpu and have made the addition gener data publicli avail for futur compar evalu 1 . to automat evalu the system-return arbitrari span of text us our answer kei, we further develop an evalu scheme with semi-automat procedur for 1 url: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/download acquir rule that can match nugget against system respons. moreov, we propos an extens of ndcg (normal discount cumul gain) [9] for assess the util of rank passag as a function of both relev and novelti. the rest of thi paper is organ as follow. section 2 outlin the inform distil process with a concret exampl. section 3 describ the technic core of our system call caf´e - cmu adapt filter engin. section 4 discuss issu with respect to evalu methodolog and propos a new scheme. section 5 describ the extend tdt4 corpu. section 6 present our experi and result. section 7 conclud the studi and give futur perspect. 2. a sampl task consid a new event - the escap of seven convict from a texa prison in decemb 2000 and their captur a month later. assum a user were interest in thi event sinc it earli stage, the inform need could be: ‘find inform about the escap of convict from texa prison, and inform relat to their recaptur". the associ lower-level question could be: 1. how mani prison escap? 2. where and when were thei sight? 3. who ar their known contact insid and outsid the prison? 4. how ar thei arm? 5. do thei have ani vehicl? 6. what step have been taken so far? we call such an inform need a task, and the associ question as the queri in thi task. a distil system is suppos to monitor the incom document, process them chunk by chunk in a tempor order, select potenti relev and novel passag from each chunk with respect to each queri, and present a rank list of passag to the user. passag rank here is base on how relev a passag is with respect to the current queri, how novel it is with respect to the current user histori (of hi or her interact with the system), and how redund it is compar to other passag with a higher rank in the list. when present with a list of passag, the user mai provid feedback by highlight arbitrari span of text that he or she found relev. these span of text ar taken as posit exampl in the adapt of the queri profil, and also ad to the user"s histori. passag not mark by the user ar taken as neg exampl. as soon as the queri profil is updat, the system re-issu a search and return anoth rank list of passag where the previous seen passag ar either remov or rank low, base on user prefer. for exampl, if the user highlight ‘...offici have post a $100,000 reward for their captur..." as relev answer to the queri what step have been taken so far?, then the highlight piec is us as an addit posit train exampl in the adapt of the queri profil. thi piec of feedback is also ad to the user histori as a seen exampl, so that in futur, the system will not place anoth passag mention ‘$100,000 reward" at the top of the rank list. howev, an articl mention ‘...offici have doubl the reward monei to $200,000..." might be rank high sinc it is both relev to the (updat) queri profil and novel with respect to the (updat) user histori. the user mai modifi the origin queri or add a new queri dure the process; the queri profil will be chang accordingli. clearli, novelti detect is veri import for the util of such a system becaus of the iter search. without novelti detect, the old relev passag would be shown to the user repeatedli in each rank list. through the abov exampl, we can see the main properti of our new framework for util-base  inform distil over tempor order document. our framework combin and extend the power of adapt filter (af), ad-hoc retriev (ir) and novelti detect (nd). compar to standard ir, our approach ha the power of increment learn long-term inform need and model a sequenc of queri within a task. compar to convent af, it enabl a more activ role of the user in refin hi or her inform need and request new result by allow relev and novelti feedback via highlight of arbitrari span of text in passag return by the system. compar to past work, thi is the first evalu of novelti detect integr with adapt filter for sequenc queri that allow flexibl user feedback over rank passag. the combin of af, ir and nd with the new extens rais an import research question regard evalu methodolog: how can we measur the util of such an inform distil system? exist metric in standard ir, af and nd ar insuffici, and new solut must be explor, as we will discuss in section 4, after describ the technic core of our system in the next section. 3. technic core the core compon of caf´e ar - 1) af for increment learn of queri profil, 2) ir for estim relev of passag with respect to queri profil, 3) nd for assess novelti of passag with respect to user"s histori, and 4) anti-redund compon to remov redund from rank list. 3.1 adapt filter compon we us a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regular logist regress method which had the best result on sever benchmark evalu corpora for af [21]. logist regress (lr) is a supervis learn algorithm for statist classif. base on a train set of label instanc, it learn a class model which can then by us to predict the label of unseen instanc. it perform as well as effici in term of train time make it a good candid when frequent updat of the class model ar requir, as is the case in adapt filter, where the system must learn from each new feedback provid by the user. (see [21] and [23] for comput complex and implement issu). in adapt filter, each queri is consid as a class and the probabl of a passag belong to thi class correspond to the degre of relev of the passag with respect to the queri. for train the model, we us the queri itself as the initi posit train exampl of the class, and the user-highlight piec of text (mark as relev or not-relev) dure feedback as addit train exampl. to address the cold start issu in the earli stage befor ani user feedback is obtain, the system us a small sampl from a retrospect corpu as the initi neg exampl in the train set. the detail of us logist regress for adapt filter (assign differ weight to posit and neg train instanc, and regular the object function to prevent over-fit on train data) ar present in [21]. the class model w∗ learn by logist regress, or the queri profil, is a vector whose dimens ar individu term and whose element ar the regress coeffici, indic how influenti each term is in the queri profil. the queri profil is updat whenev a new piec of user feedback is receiv. a tempor decai weight can be appli to each train exampl, as an option, to emphas the most recent user feedback. 3.2 passag retriev compon we us standard ir techniqu in thi part of our system. incom document ar process in chunk, where each chunk can be defin as a fix span of time or as a fix number of document, as prefer by the user. for each incom document, corpu statist like the idf (invert document frequenc) of each term ar updat. we us a state-of-the-art name entiti identifi and tracker [8, 12] to identifi person and locat name, and merg them with co-refer name entiti seen in the past. then the document ar segment into passag, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentenc, or ani other continu span of text, as prefer. each passag is repres us a vector of tf-idf (term  frequencyinvers document frequenc) weight, where term can be a word or a name entiti. given a queri profil, i.e. the logist regress solut w∗ as describ in section 3.1, the system comput the posterior probabl of relev for each passag x as frl(x) ≡ p(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) passag ar order by their relev score, and the on with score abov a threshold (tune on a train set) compris the relev list that is pass on to the novelti detect step. 3.3 novelti detect compon caf´e maintain a user histori h(t), which contain all the span of text hi that the user highlight (as feedback) dure hi or her past interact with the system, up to the current time t. denot the histori as h(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelti score of a new candid passag x is comput as: fnd(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {co(x, hi)} (3) where both candid passag x and highlight span of text hi ar repres as tf-idf vector. the novelti score of each passag is compar to a  prespecifi threshold (also tune on a train set), and ani passag with a score below thi threshold is remov from the relev list. 3.4 anti-redund rank compon although the novelti detect compon ensur that onli novel (previous unseen) inform remain in the relev list, thi list might still contain the same novel inform at multipl posit in the rank list. suppos, for exampl, that the user ha alreadi read about a $100,000 reward for inform about the escap convict. a new piec of new that the award ha been increas to $200,000 is novel sinc the user hasn"t read about it yet. howev, multipl new sourc would report thi new and we might end up show (redund) articl from all these sourc in a rank list. henc, a rank list should also be made non-redund with respect to it own content. we us a simplifi version of the maxim margin relev method [5], origin develop for combin relev and novelti in text retriev and summar. our procedur start with the current list of passag sort by relev (section 3.2), filter by novelti detect compon (section 3.3), and gener a new non-redund list as follow: 1. take the top passag in the current list as the top on in the new list. 2. add the next passag x in the current list to the new list onli if far(x) > t where far(x) = 1 − max pi∈lnew {co(x, pi)} and lnew is the set of passag alreadi select in the new list. 3. repeat step 2 until all the passag in the current list have been examin. after appli the abov-mention algorithm, each passag in the new list is suffici dissimilar to other, thu favor divers rather than redund in the new rank list. the anti-redund threshold t is tune on a train set. 4. evalu methodolog the approach we propos abov for inform  distil rais import issu regard evalu  methodolog. firstli, sinc our framework allow the output to be passag at differ level of granular (e.g. k-sentenc window where k mai vari) instead of a fix length, it is not possibl to have pre-annot relev judgment at all such granular level. secondli, sinc we wish to measur the util of the system output as a combin of both relev and novelti, tradit relev-onli base measur must be replac by measur that penal the repetit of the same inform in the system output across time. thirdli, sinc the output of the system is rank list, we must reward those system that present us inform (both relev and previous unseen) us shorter rank list, and penal those that present the same inform us longer rank list. none of the exist measur in ad-hoc retriev, adapt filter, novelti detect or other relat area (text summar and question answer) have desir properti in all the three aspect. therefor, we must develop a new evalu methodolog. 4.1 answer kei to enabl the evalu of a system whose output consist of passag of arbitrari length, we borrow the concept of answer kei from the question answer (qa) commun, where system ar allow to return arbitrari span of text as answer. answer kei defin what should be present in a system respons to receiv credit, and ar compris of a collect of inform nugget, i.e. factoid unit about which human assessor can make binari decis of whether or not a system respons contain them. defin answer kei and make the associ binari decis ar conceptu task that requir semant  map [19], sinc system-return passag can contain the same inform express in mani differ wai. henc, qa evalu have reli on human assessor for the map between variou express, make the process costli, time consum, and not scalabl to larg queri and document collect, and extens system evalu with variou paramet set. 4.1.1 autom evalu base on answer kei automat evalu method would allow for faster system build and tune, as well as provid an object and afford wai of compar variou system. recent, such method have been propos, more or less, base on the idea of n-gram co-occurr. pourpr [10] assign a fraction recal score to a system respons base on it unigram overlap with a given nugget"s descript. for exampl, a system respons ‘a b c" ha recal 3/4 with respect to a nugget with descript ‘a b c d". howev, such an approach is unfair to system that present the same inform but us word other than a, b, c, and d. anoth open issu is how to weight individu word in measur the close of a match. for exampl, consid the question how mani prison escap?. in the nugget ‘seven prison escap from a texa prison", there is no indic that ‘seven" is the keyword, and that it must be match to get ani relev credit. us idf valu doe not help, sinc ‘seven" will gener not have a higher idf than word like ‘texa" and ‘prison". also, redefin the nugget as just ‘seven" doe not solv the problem sinc now it might spurious match ani mention of ‘seven" out of context. nugget [13] work on similar principl but make binari decis about whether a nugget is present in a given system respons by tune a threshold. howev, it is also plagu by ‘spuriou relev" sinc not all word contain in the nugget descript (or known correct respons) ar central to the nugget. 4.1.2 nugget-match rule we propos a reliabl automat method for determin whether a snippet of text contain a given nugget, base on nugget-match rule, which ar gener us a  semiautomat procedur explain below. these rule ar essenti boolean queri that will onli match against snippet that contain the nugget. for instanc, a candid rule for match answer to how mani prison  escap? is (texa and seven and escap and (convict or prison)), possibl with other synonym and variant in the rule. for a corpu of new articl, which usual follow a typic formal prose, it is fairli easi to write such simpl rule to match expect answer us a bootstrap approach, as describ below. we propos a two-stage approach, inspir by autoslog [14], that combin the strength of human in identifi semant equival express and the strength of the system in gather statist evid from a  humanannot corpu of document. in the first stage, human subject annot (us a highlight tool) portion of  ontop document that contain answer to each nugget 2 . in the second stage, subject us our rule gener tool to creat rule that would match the annot for each nugget. the tool allow user to enter a boolean rule as a disjunct of conjunct (e.g. ((a and b) or (a and c and d) or (e))). given a candid rule, our tool us it as a boolean queri over the entir set of on-topic document and calcul it recal and precis with respect to the annot that it is expect to match. henc, the subject can start with a simpl rule and iter refin it until thei ar satisfi with it recal and precis. we observ that it wa veri easi for human to improv the precis of a rule by tweak it exist conjunct (ad more and), and improv the recal by ad more conjunct to the disjunct (ad more or). as an exampl, let"s try to creat a rule for the nugget which sai that seven prison escap from the texa prison. we start with a simpl rule - (seven). when we input thi into the rule gener tool, we realiz that thi rule match mani spuriou occurr of seven (e.g. ‘...seven state...") and thu get a low precis score. we can further qualifi our rule - texa and seven and convict. next, by look at the ‘miss annot", we realiz that some new articl mention ...seven prison escap.... we then replac convict with the disjunct (convict or prison). we continu tweak the rule in thi manner until we achiev a suffici high recal and precis - i.e. the (small number of) miss and fals alarm can be safe ignor. thu we can creat nugget-match rule that succinctli captur variou wai of express a nugget, while avoid match incorrect (or out of context) respons. human involv in the rule creation process ensur high qualiti gener rule which can then be us to evalu arbitrari system respons reliabl. 4.2 evalu the util of a sequenc of rank list the util of a retriev system can be defin as the differ between how much the user gain in term of us inform, and how much the user lost in term of time and energi. we calcul thi util from the util of individu passag as follow. after read each passag return by the system, the user deriv some gain depend on the presenc of relev and novel inform, and incur a loss in term of the time and energi spent in go through the passag. howev, the likelihood that the user would actual read a passag depend on it posit in the rank list. henc, for a queri q, the expect util 2 ldc [18] alreadi provid relev judgment for 100 topic on the tdt4 corpu. we further ensur that these judgment ar exhaust on the entir corpu us pool. of a passag pi at rank i can be defin as u(pi, q) = p(i) ∗ (gain(pi, q) − loss(pi, q)) (4) where p(i) is the probabl that the user would go through a passag at rank i. the expect util for an entir rank list of length n can be calcul simpli by ad the expect util of each passag: u(q) = nx i=1 p(i) ∗ (gain(pi, q) − loss(pi, q)) (5) note that if we ignor the loss term and defin p(i) as p(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recent popular metric call  discount cumul gain (dcg) [9], where gain(pi, q) is defin as the grade relev of passag pi. howev, without the loss term, dcg is a pure recal-orient metric and not suitabl for an adapt filter set, where the system"s util depend in part on it abil to limit the number of item shown to the user. although p(i) could be defin base on empir studi of user behavior, for simplic, we us p(i) exactli as defin in equat 6. the gain g(pi, q) of passag pi with respect to the queri q is a function of - 1) the number of relev nugget present in pi, and 2) the novelti of each of these nugget. we combin these two factor as follow. for each nugget nj, we assign an initi weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of time thi nugget ha been seen by the user in the past. the gain deriv from each subsequ occurr of the same nugget is assum to reduc by a dampen factor γ. thu, g(pi, q) is defin as g(pi, q) = x nj ∈c(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where c(pi, q) is the set of all nugget that appear in passag pi and also belong to the answer kei of queri q. the initi weight wj ar all set of be 1.0 in our experi, but can also be set base on a pyramid approach [11]. the choic of dampen factor γ determin the user"s toler for redund. when γ = 0, a nugget will onli receiv credit for it first occurr i.e. when nj is zero3 . for 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receiv smaller credit for each success occurr. when γ = 1, no dampen occur and repeat occurr of a nugget receiv the same credit. note that the nugget occurr count ar preserv between evalu of success rank list return by the system, sinc the user ar expect to rememb what the system show them in the past. we defin the loss l(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we us 0.1) incur when read a system-return passag. thu, our metric can be re-written as u(q) = nx i=1 gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − l(n) (8) where l(n) is the loss associ with a rank list of length n: l(n) = c · nx i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 note that 00 = 1 due to the similar with discount cumul gain (dcg), we call our metric discount cumul util (dcu). the dcu score obtain by the system is convert to a normal dcu (ndcu) score by divid it by the dcu score of the ideal rank list, which is creat by order passag by their decreas util score u(pi, q) and stop when u(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of read the passag. 5. data tdt4 wa the benchmark corpu us in tdt2002 and tdt2003 evalu. the corpu consist of over 90, 000 new articl from multipl sourc (ap, nyt, cnn, abc, nbc, msnbc, xinhua, zaobao, voic of america, pri the world, etc.) publish between octob 2000 and januari 2001, in the languag of arab, english, and mandarin. speech-recogn and machin-translat version of the non-english articl were provid as well. ldc [18] ha annot the corpu with 100 topic, that correspond to variou new event in thi time period. out of these, we select a subset of 12 action event, and defin correspond task for them4 . for each task, we manual defin a profil consist of an initi set of (5 to 10) queri, a free-text descript of the user histori, i.e., what the user alreadi know about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic document (if avail) as train exampl. for each queri, we gener answer kei and  correspond nugget match rule us the procedur describ in section 4.1.2, and produc a total of 120 queri, with an averag of 7 nugget per queri. 6. experi and result 6.1 baselin we us indri [17], a popular languag-model base retriev engin, as a baselin for comparison with caf´e. indri support standard search engin function,  includ pseudo-relev feedback (prf) [3, 6], and is repres of a typic queri-base retriev system. indri doe not support ani kind of novelti detect. we compar indri with prf turn on and off, against caf´e with user feedback, novelti detect and  antiredund rank turn on and off. 6.2 experiment setup we divid the tdt4 corpu span 4 month into 10 chunk, each defin as a period of 12 consecut dai. at ani given point of time in the distil process, each system access the past data up to the current point, and return a rank list of up 50 passag per queri. the 12 task defin on the corpu were divid into a train and test set with 6 task each. each system wa allow to us the train set to tune it paramet for optim ndcu (equat 8), includ the relev threshold for both indri and caf´e, and the novelti and  antiredund threshold for caf´e. the ndcu for each system run is calcul  automat. user feedback wa also simul - relev judgment for each system-return passag (as determin by the nugget match rule describ in section 4.1.2) were 4 url: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/download figur 1: perform of indri across chunk figur 2: perform of caf´e across chunk us as user feedback in the adapt of queri profil and user histori. 6.3 result in tabl 1, we show the ndcu score of the two system under variou set. these score ar averag over the six task in the test set, and ar calcul with two dampen factor (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simul no toler and small toler for redund, respect. us γ = 0 creat a much more strict metric sinc it doe not give ani credit to a passag that contain relev but redund inform. henc, the improv obtain from enabl user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improv obtain from feedback with γ = 0.1. thi reveal a shortcom of contemporari retriev  systemswhen the user give posit feedback on a passag, the system give higher weight to the term present in that passag and tend to retriev other passag contain the same term - and thu - usual the same inform. howev, the user doe not benefit from see such redund passag, and is usual interest in other passag contain relat inform. it is inform to evalu retriev system us our util measur (with γ = 0) which account for novelti and thu give a more realist pictur of how well a system can gener from user feedback, rather than us tradit ir measur like recal and precis which give an incomplet pictur of improv obtain from user feedback. sometim, howev, user might inde be interest in see the same inform from multipl sourc, as an tabl 1: ndcu score of indri and caf´e for two dampen factor (γ), and variou set (f: feedback, n: novelti detect, a: anti-redund rank) indri caf´e γ base +prf base +f +f+n +f+a +f+n+a 0 0.19 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.24 0.24 0.1 0.28 0.29 0.24 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.36 indic of it import or reliabl. in such a case, we can simpli choos a higher valu for γ which correspond to a higher toler for redund, and henc let the system tune it paramet accordingli. sinc document were process chunk by chunk, it would be interest to see how the perform of system improv over time. figur 1 and 2 show the perform trend for both the system across chunk. while the perform with and without feedback on the first few chunk is expect to be close, for subsequ chunk, the perform curv with feedback enabl rise abov the on with the no-feedback set. the perform trend ar not consist across all chunk becaus on-topic document ar not uniformli distribut over all the chunk, make some queri ‘easier" than other in certain chunk. moreov, sinc indri us pseudo-relev feedback while caf´e us feedback base on actual relev judgment, the improv in case of indri is less dramat than that of caf´e. 7. conclud remark thi paper present the first investig on util-base inform distil with a system that learn the  longlast inform need from fine-grain user feedback over a sequenc of rank passag. our system, call caf´e, combin adapt filter, novelti detect and  antiredund passag rank in a unifi framework for util optim. we develop a new scheme for autom evalu and feedback base on a semi-automat  procedur for acquir rule that allow automat match nugget against system respons. we also propos an extens of the ndcg metric for assess the util of rank passag as a weight combin of relev and novelti. our experi on the newli annot tdt4 benchmark corpu show encourag util enhanc over indri, and also over our own system with increment learn and novelti detect turn off. 8. acknowledg we would like to thank rosta farzan, jonathan
