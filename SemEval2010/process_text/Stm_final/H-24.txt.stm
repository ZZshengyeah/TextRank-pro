investig the queri and brows behavior of advanc search engin user ryen w. white microsoft research on microsoft wai redmond, wa 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com dan morri microsoft research on microsoft wai redmond, wa 98052 dan@microsoft.com abstract on wai to help all user of commerci web search engin be more success in their search is to better understand what those user with greater search expertis ar do, and us thi knowledg to benefit everyon. in thi paper we studi the interact log of advanc search engin user (and those not so advanc) to better understand how these user group search. the result show that there ar mark differ in the queri, result click, post-queri brows, and search success of user we classifi as advanc (base on their us of queri oper), rel to those classifi as non-advanc. our find have implic for how advanc user should be support dure their search, and how their interact could be us to help searcher of all experi level find more relev inform and learn improv search strategi. categori and subject descriptor h.3.3 [inform search and retriev]: queri formul, search process, relev feedback. gener term experiment, human factor. 1. introduct the formul of queri statement that captur both the salient aspect of inform need and ar meaning to inform retriev (ir) system pose a challeng for mani searcher [3]. commerci web search engin such as googl, yahoo!, and window live search offer user the abil to improv the qualiti of their queri us queri oper such as quotat mark, plu and minu sign, and modifi that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file. these techniqu can be us in improv result precis yet, other than via log analys (e.g., [15][27]), thei have gener been overlook by the research commun in attempt to improv the qualiti of search result. ir research ha gener focus on altern wai for user to specifi their need rather than increas the uptak of advanc syntax. research on practic techniqu to supplement exist search technolog and support user ha been intensifi in recent year (e.g. [18][34]). howev, it is challeng to implement such techniqu at larg scale with toler latenc. typic queri submit to web search engin take the form of a seri of token separ by space. there is gener an impli boolean and oper between token that restrict search result to document contain all queri term. de lima and pedersen [7] investig the effect of pars, phrase recognit, and expans on web search queri. thei show that the automat recognit of phrase in queri can improv result precis in web search. howev, the valu of advanc syntax for typic searcher ha gener been limit, sinc most user do not know about advanc syntax or do not understand how to us it [15]. sinc it appear oper can help retriev relev document, further investig of their us is warrant. in thi paper we explor the us of queri oper in more detail and propos altern applic that do not requir all user to us advanc syntax explicitli. we hypothes that searcher who us advanc queri syntax demonstr a degre of search expertis that the major of the user popul doe not; an assert support by previou research [13]. studi the behavior of these advanc search engin user mai yield import insight about search and result brows from which other mai benefit. us log gather from a larg number of consent user, we investig differ between the search behavior of those that us advanc syntax and those that do not, and differ in the inform those user target. we ar interest in answer three research question: (i) is there a relationship between the us of advanc syntax and other characterist of a search? (ii) is there a relationship between the us of advanc syntax and post-queri navig behavior? (iii) is there a relationship between the us of advanc syntax and measur of search success? through an experiment studi and analysi, we offer potenti answer for each of these question. a relationship between the us of advanc syntax and ani of these featur could support the design of system tailor to advanc search engin user, or us advanc user" interact to help non-advanc user be more success in their search. we describ relat work in section 2, the data we us in thi log-base studi in section 3, the search characterist on which we focu our analysi in section 4, and the find of thi analysi in section 5. in section 6 we discuss the implic of thi research, and we conclud in section 7. 2. relat work factor such as lack of domain knowledg, poor understand of the document collect be search, and a poorli develop inform need can all influenc the qualiti of the queri that user submit to ir system ([24],[28]). there ha been a varieti of research into differ wai of help user specifi their inform need more effect. belkin et al. [4] experi with provid addit space for user to type a more verbos descript of their inform need. a similar approach wa attempt by kelli et al. [18], who us clarif form to elicit addit inform about the search context from user. these approach have been shown to be effect in best-match retriev system where longer queri gener lead to more relev search result [4]. howev, in web search, where mani of the system ar base on an extend boolean retriev model, longer queri mai actual hurt retriev perform, lead to a small number of potenti irrelev result be retriev. it is not simpli suffici to request more inform from user; thi inform must be of better qualiti. relev feedback (rf) [22] and interact queri expans [9] ar popular techniqu that have been us to improv the qualiti of inform that user provid to ir system regard their inform need. in the case of rf, the user present the system with exampl of relev inform that ar then us to formul an improv queri or retriev a new set of document. it ha proven difficult to get user to us rf in the web domain due to difficulti in convei the mean and the benefit of rf to typic user [17]. queri suggest offer base on queri log have the potenti to improv retriev perform with limit user burden. thi approach is limit to re-execut popular queri, and searcher often ignor the suggest present to them [1]. in addit, both of these techniqu do not help user learn to produc more effect queri. most commerci search engin provid advanc queri syntax that allow user to specifi their inform need in more detail. queri modifi such as ‘+" (plu), ‘−" (minu), and ‘  " (doubl quot) can be us to emphas, deemphas, and group queri term. boolean oper (and, or, and not) can join term and phrase, and modifi such as site: and link: can be us to restrict the search space. queri creat with these techniqu can be power. howev, thi function is often hidden from the immedi view of the searcher, and unless she know the syntax, she must us text field, pull-down menu and combo box avail via a dedic advanc search interfac to access these featur. log-base analysi of user" interact with the excit and altavista search engin ha shown that onli 10-20% of queri contain ani advanc syntax [14][25]. thi analysi can be a us wai of captur characterist of user interact with ir system. research in user model [6] and person [30] ha shown that gather more inform about user can improv the effect of search, but requir more inform about user than is typic avail from interact log alon. unless coupl with a qualit techniqu, such as a post-session questionnair [23], it can be difficult to associ interact with user characterist. in our studi we conjectur that given the difficulti in locat advanc search featur within the typic search interfac, and the potenti problem in understand the syntax, those user that do us advanc syntax regularli repres a distinct class of searcher who will exhibit other common search behavior. other studi of advanc searcher" search behavior have attempt to better understand the strateg knowledg thei have acquir. howev, such studi ar gener limit in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focu on domain expertis in area such as healthcar or e-commerc (e.g., [5]). nonetheless, thei can give valuabl insight about the behavior of user with domain, system, or search expertis that exce that of the averag user. queri behavior in particular ha been studi extens to better understand user [31] and support other user [16]. in thi paper we studi other search characterist of user of advanc syntax in an attempt to determin whether there is anyth differ about how these search engin user search, and whether their search can be us to benefit those who do not make us of the advanc featur of search engin. to do thi we us interact log gather from larg set of consent user over a prolong period. in the next section we describ the data we us to studi the behavior of the user who us advanc syntax, rel to those that do not us thi syntax. 3. data to perform thi studi we requir a descript of the queri and brows behavior of mani searcher, prefer over a period of time to allow pattern in user behavior to be analyz. to obtain these data we mine the interact log of consent web user over a period of 13 week, from januari to april 2006. when download a partner client-side applic, the user were invit to consent to their interact with web page be anonym record (with a uniqu identifi assign to each user) and us to improv the perform of futur system.1 the inform contain in these log entri includ a uniqu identifi for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a uniqu browser window identifi (to resolv ambigu in determin which browser a page wa view), and the url of the web page visit. thi provid us with suffici data on queri behavior (from interact with search engin), and brows behavior (from interact with the page that follow a search) to more broadli investig search behavior. in addit to the data gather dure the cours of thi studi we also had relev judgment of document that user examin for 10,680 uniqu queri statement present in the interact log. these judgment were assign on a six-point scale by train human judg at the time the data were collect. we us these judgment in thi analysi to assess the relev of site user visit on their brows trail awai from search result page. we studi the interact log of 586,029 uniqu user, who submit million of queri to three popular search  enginesgoogl, yahoo!, and msn search - over the 13-week durat of the studi. to limit the effect of search engin bia, we us four oper common to all three search engin: + (plu), − (minu),   (doubl quot), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or web page) as advanc syntax. 1.12% of the queri submit contain at least on of these four oper. 51,080 (8.72%) of user us queri oper in ani of their queri. in the remaind of thi paper, we will refer to these user as advanc searcher. we acknowledg that the direct relationship between queri syntax usag and search expertis ha onli been studi 1 it is worth note that if user did not provid their consent, then their interact wa not record and analyz in thi studi. (and shown) in a few studi (e.g., [13]), but we feel that thi is a reason criterion for a log-base investig. we conjectur that these advanc searcher do possess a high level of search expertis, and will show later in the paper that thei demonstr behavior characterist consist with search expertis. to handl potenti outlier user that mai skew our data analysi, we remov user who submit fewer than 50 queri in the studi"s 13-week durat. thi left us with 188,405 user − 37,795 (20.1%) advanc user and 150,610 (79.9%)  nonadvanc user − whose interact we studi in more detail. if signific differ emerg between these group, it is conceiv that these interact could be us to automat classifi user and adjust a search system"s interfac and result weight to better match the current user. the privaci of our volunt wa maintain throughout the entir cours of the studi: no person inform wa elicit about them, particip were assign a uniqu anonym identifi that could not be trace back to them, and we made no attempt to identifi a particular user or studi individu behavior in ani wai. all find were aggreg over multipl user, and no inform other than consent for log wa elicit. to find out more about these user we studi whether those us advanc syntax exhibit other search behavior that were not observ in those who did not us thi syntax. we focus on queri, navig, and overal search success to compar the user group. in the next section we describ in more detail the search featur that we us. 4. search featur we elect to choos featur that describ a varieti of aspect of the search process: queri, result click, post-queri brows, and search success. the queri and result-click characterist we chose to examin ar describ in more detail in tabl 1. tabl 1. queri and result-click featur (per user). featur mean queri per second (qp) avg. number of queri per second between initi queri and end-of-session queri repeat rate (qrr) fraction of queri that ar repeat queri word length (qwl) avg. number of word

result click interv these seven featur give us a us overview of user" direct interact with search engin, but not of how user ar look for relev inform beyond the result page or how success thei ar in locat relev inform. therefor, in addit to these characterist we also studi some relev aspect of user" post-queri brows behavior. to do thi, we extract search trail from the interact log describ in the previou section. a search trail is a seri of visit web page connect via a hyperlink trail, initi with a search result page and termin on on of the follow event: navig to ani page not link from the current page, close of the activ browser window, or a session inact timeout of 30 minut. more detail on the extract of the search trail ar provid in previou work [33]. in total, around 12.5 million search trail (contain around 60 million document) were extract from the log for all user. the median number of search trail per user wa 30. the median number of step in the trail wa 3. all search trail contain on search result page and at least on page on a hyperlink trail lead from the result page. the extract of these trail allow us to studi aspect of  postqueri brows behavior, name the averag durat of user" search session, the averag durat of user" search trail, the averag displai time of each document, the averag number of step in user" search trail, the number of branch in user" navig pattern, and the number of back oper in user" search trail. all search trail contain at least on branch repres ani forward motion on the brows path. a trail can have addit branch if the user click the browser"s back button and immedi proce forward to anoth page prior to the next (if ani) back oper. the post-queri brows featur ar describ further in tabl 2. tabl 2. post-queri brows featur

us these attribut of user" interact, we also us the relev judgment describ earlier in the paper to measur the degre of search success base on the relev judgment assign to page that lie on the search trail. given that we did not have access to relev assess from our user, we approxim these assess us judgment collect as part of ongo research into search engin perform.2 these judgment were creat by train human assessor for 10,680 uniqu queri. of the 1,420,625 step on search trail that start with ani on of these queri, we have relev judgment for 802,160 (56.4%). we us these judgment to approxim search success for a given trail in a number of wai. in tabl 3 we list these measur. 2 our assess of search success is fairli crude compar to what would have been possibl if we had been abl to contact our subject. we address thi problem in a manner similar to that us by the text retriev confer (trec) [21], in that sinc we cannot determin perceiv search success, we approxim search success base on assign relev score of visit document. tabl 3. relev judgment measur (per trail). measur mean first judgment assign to the first page in the trail last judgment assign to the last page in the trail

trail, and allow us to estim search success in differ wai. we chose multipl measur, as user mai encount relev inform in mani wai and at differ point in the trail (e.g., singl  highlyrelev document or gradual over the cours of the trail). the featur describ in thi section allow us to analyz import attribut of the search process that must be better understood if we ar to support user in their search. in the next section we present the find of the analysi. 5. find our analysi is divid into three part: analysi of queri behavior and interact with the result page, analysi of post-queri navig behavior, and search success in term of locat judg-relev document. parametr statist test is us, and the level of signific for the statist test is set to .05. 5.1 queri and result-click behavior we were interest in compar the queri and result-click behavior of our advanc and non-advanc user. in tabl 4 we show the mean averag valu for each of the seven search featur for our user. we us padvanc to denot the percentag of all queri from each user that contain advanc syntax (i.e., padvanc = 0% mean a user never us advanc syntax). the tabl show valu for user that do not us queri oper (0%), user who submit at least on queri with oper (≥ 0%), through to user whose queri contain oper at least  threequart of the time (≥ 75%). tabl 4. queri and result click featur (per user). featur padvanc 0% > 0% ≥

advanc syntax in at least on queri (padvanc > 0%). the column correspond to these two group ar bold in tabl 4. we perform an independ measur  ttest between these group for each of the featur. sinc thi analysi involv mani featur, we us a bonferroni correct to control the experi-wise error rate and set the alpha level (α) to .007, i.e., .05 divid by the number of featur. thi correct reduc the number of type i error i.e., reject null hypothes that ar true. all differ between the group were statist signific (all t(188403) ≥ 2.81, all p ≤ .002). howev, given the larg sampl size, all differ in the mean were like to be statist signific. we appli a cohen"s d-test to determin the effect size for each of the comparison between the advanc and non-advanc user group. order in descend order by effect size, the main find ar that rel to non-advanc user, advanc search engin user: • queri less frequent in a session (d = 1.98) • compos longer queri (d = .69) • click further down the result list (d = .67) • submit more queri per dai (d = .49) • ar less like to click on a result (d = .32) • repeat queri more often (d = .16) the increas likelihood that advanc search engin user will click further down the result list impli that thei mai be less trust of the search engin" abil to rank the most relev document first, that thei ar more will to explor beyond the most popular page for a given queri, that thei mai be submit differ type of queri (e.g., inform rather than navig), or that thei mai have custom their search set to displai more than onli the default top-10 result. mani of the find list ar consist with those identifi in other studi of advanc searcher" queri and result-click behavior [13][34]. given that the onli criteria we emploi to classifi a user as an advanc searcher wa their us of advanc syntax, it is certainli promis that thi criterion seem to identifi user that interact in a wai consist with that report previous for those with more search expertis. as mention earlier, the advanc search engin user for which the averag valu shown in tabl 4 ar comput ar those who submit 50 or more queri in the 13 week durat of the data collect and submit at least on queri contain advanc queri oper. in other word, we consid user whose percentag of queri contain advanc syntax, padvanc, is greater than zero. the us of queri oper in ani queri, regardless of frequenc, suggest that a user know about the exist of the oper, and impli a greater degre of familiar with the search system. we further hypothes that user whose queri more frequent contain advanc syntax mai be more advanc search engin user. to test thi we investig vari the queri threshold requir to qualifi for advanc statu (padvanc). we increment padvanc on percentag point at a time, and record the valu of the seven queri and result-click featur at each point. the valu of the featur at four mileston (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75%) ar shown in tabl 4. as can be seen in the tabl, as padvanc increas, differ in the featur between those us advanc syntax and those not us advanc syntax becom more substanti. howev, it is interest to note that as padvanc increas, the number of queri submit per dai actual fall (pearson"s r = −.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). more advanc user mai need to pose fewer queri to find relev inform. to studi the pattern of relationship among these depend variabl (includ the padvanc), we appli factor analysi [26]. tabl 5 show the intercorrel matrix between the featur and the percentag of queri with oper (padvanc). each cell in the tabl contain the pearson"s correl coeffici between the two featur for a given row-column pair. tabl 5. intercorrel matrix (queri / result-click featur). padv. qp qrr qwl qpd acp cp asc padv. 1.00 .946 .970 .987 −.512 .930 −.746 −.583 qp 1.00 .944 .943 −.643

reflect the correl between padvanc and the other queri and result-click featur. column 2 - 8 show the inter-correl between the other featur. there ar strong posit correl between some of the featur (e.g., the number of word in the queri (qwl) and the averag probabl of click on a search result (acp)). howev, there were also fairli strong neg correl between some featur (e.g., the averag length of the queri (qwl) and the probabl of click on a search result (cp)). the factor analysi reveal the presenc of two factor that account for 83.6% of the varianc. as is standard practic in factor analysi, all featur with an absolut factor load of .30 or less were remov. the two factor that emerg, with their respect load, can be express as: factor a = .98(qrr) + .97(padv) + .97(qp) + .71(acp) + .69(qwl) factor b = .96(cp) + .90(qpd) + .67(acp) + .52(asc) varianc in the queri and result-click behavior of our advanc search engin user can be express us these two construct. factor a is the most power, contribut 50.5% of the varianc. it appear to repres a veri basic dimens of varianc that cover queri attribut and queri behavior, and suggest a relationship between queri properti (length, frequenc, complex, and repetit) and the posit of user" click in the result list. the dimens underli factor b account for 33.1% of the varianc, and describ attribut of result-click behavior, and a strong correl between result click and the number of queri submit each dai. summari: in thi section we have shown that there ar mark differ in aspect of the queri and result-clickthrough behavior of advanc user rel to non-advanc user. we have also shown that the greater the proport of queri that contain advanc syntax, the larger the differ in queri and clickthrough behavior becom. a factor analysi reveal the presenc of two dimens that adequ character varianc in the queri and result-click featur. in the queri dimens queri attribut, such as the length and proport that contain advanc syntax, and queri behavior, such as the number of queri submit per dai both affect result-click posit. in addit, in the result-click dimens, it appear that daili queri frequenc influenc result-click featur such as the likelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount of time between result present and the search result click. the featur us in thi section ar onli interact with search engin in the form of queri and result click. we did not address how user search for inform beyond the result page. in the next section we us the search trail describ in section 4 to analyz the post-queri brows behavior of user. 5.2 post-queri brows behavior in thi section we look at sever attribut of the search trail user follow beyond the result page in an attempt to discern whether the us of advanc search syntax can be us as a predictor of aspect of post-queri interact behavior. as we did previous, we first describ the mean averag valu for each of the brows featur, across all advanc user (i.e. padvanc > 0%), all non-advanc user (i.e., padvanc = 0%), and all user regardless of their estim search expertis level. we then look at the effect on the brows featur of increas the valu of padvanc requir to be consid advanc from 1% to 100%. in tabl 6 we present the averag valu for each of these featur for the two group of user. also shown ar the percentag of search trail (%trail) and the percentag of user (%user) us to comput the averag. tabl 6. post-queri brows featur (per trail). featur padvanc 0% > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% session sec. 701.10 706.21 792.65 903.01 1114.71 trail sec. 205.39 159.56

.23% .05% %user 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04% as can be seen from tabl 6, there ar differ in the  postqueri interact behavior of advanc user (padvanc > 0%) rel to that do not us queri oper in ani of their queri (padvanc = 0%). onc again, the column of interest in thi comparison ar bold. as we did in section 5.1 for queri and result-click behavior, we perform an independ measur  ttest between the valu report for each of the post-queri brows featur. the result of thi test suggest that differ between those that us advanc syntax and those that do not ar signific (t(12495029) ≥ 3.09, p ≤ .002, α = .008). given the sampl size, all of the differ between mean in the two group were signific. howev, we onc again appli a cohen"s d-test to determin the effect size. the find (rank in descend order base on effect size), show that rel to non-advanc user, advanc search engin user: • revisit page in the trail less often (d = .45) • spend less time travers each search trail (d = .38) • spend less time view each document (d = .28) • branch (i.e., proce to new page follow a back oper) less often (d = .18) • follow search trail with fewer step (d = .16) it seem that advanc user us a more direct search style than non-advanc user. thei spend less time follow search trail and view the document that lie on those trail for less time. thi is in accord with our earlier proposit that advanc user seem abl to discern document relev in less time. advanc user also tend to deviat less from a direct path as thei search, with fewer revisit to previous-visit page and less branch dure their search. as we did in the previou section, we increas the padvanc threshold on point at a time. with the except of number of back oper (nb), the valu attribut to each of the featur chang as padvanc increas. it seem that the differ note earlier between non-advanc user and those that us ani advanc syntax becom more signific as padvanc increas. as in the previou section, we conduct a factor analysi of these featur and padvanc. tabl 7 show the intercorrel matrix for all these variabl. tabl 7. intercorrel matrix (post-queri brows). padv ss ts ds ns nb nba padv 1.00 .977 −.843 −.867 −.395 −.339 −.249 ss 1.00 −.765

post-queri brows featur decreas. onli the averag session time (ss) exhibit a strong posit correl with padvanc. the factor analysi reveal the presenc of two factor that account for 89.8% of the varianc. onc again, all featur with an absolut factor load of .30 or less were remov. the two factor that emerg, with their respect load, can be express as: factor a = .95(ds) + .88 (ts) − .91(ss) − .95(padv) factor b = .99(nba) + .93(ns) + .91(nb) varianc in the queri and result-click behavior of those who us queri oper can be express us these two construct. factor a is the most power, contribut 50.1% of the varianc. it appear to repres a veri basic tempor dimens that cover time and percentag of queri with advanc syntax, and suggest a neg relationship between time spent search and overal session time, and a neg relationship between time spent search and padvanc. the navig dimens underli factor b account for 39.7% of the varianc, and describ attribut of post-queri navig, all of which seem to be strongli correl with each other but not padvanc or time. summari: in thi section we have shown that advanc user" post-queri brows behavior appear more direct than that of non-advanc user. although their search session ar longer, advanc user follow fewer search trail dure their session, (i.e., submit fewer queri), their search trail ar shorter, and their trail exhibit fewer deviat or regress to previous encount page. we also show that as padvanc increas, session time increas (perhap more advanc user ar multitask between search and other oper), and search interact becom more focus, perhap becaus advanc user ar abl target relev inform more effect, with less need for regress or deviat in their search trail. as well as interact behavior such as queri, result click, and post-queri brows behavior, anoth import aspect of the search process is the attain of inform relev to the queri. in the next section we analyz the success of advanc and non-advanc user in obtain relev inform. 5.3 search success as describ earlier, we us six-level relev judgment assign to queri-document pair as an approxim measur of search success base on document encount on search trail. howev, the queri for which we have judgment gener did not contain advanc oper. to maxim the likelihood of coverag we remov advanc oper from all queri when retriev the relev judgment. the mean averag relev judgment valu for each of the four metric - first, last, averag, and maximum - ar shown in tabl 8 for non-advanc user (0%) and advanc user (> 0%). tabl 8. search success (min. = 1, max. = 6) (per trail). featur padvanc 0% > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% first m 4.03 4.19 4.24 4.26 4.57 sd 1.58 1.56 1.34 1.38 1.27 last m 3.79 3.92 4.00 4.13 4.35 sd 1.60 1.57 1.29 1.25 .89 max. m 4.04 4.20 4.19 4.19 4.46 sd 1.63

those who never us advanc syntax (padvanc = 0%). not onli were these user more success in their search, but thei were consist more success (i.e., the standard deviat in relev score is lower for advanc user and continu to drop as padvanc increas). the differ in the four mean averag relev score for each metric between these two user group were signific with independ measur t-test (all t(516765) ≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125). as we increas the valu of padvanc as in previou section, the averag relev score across all metric also increas (all pearson"s r ≥ .654), suggest that more advanc user ar also more like to succe in their search. the searcher that us advanc oper mai have addit skill in locat relev inform, or mai know where thi inform resid base on previou experi.3 despit the fact that the four metric target differ part of the search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or differ wai to gather relev inform (e.g., averag vs. maximum), the differ between group and within the advanc group were consist. 3 although in our log there wa no obviou indic of more revisit by advanc search engin user. to see whether there were ani differ in the natur of the queri submit by advanc search engin user, we studi the distribut of the four advanc oper: quotat mark, plu, minu, and site:. in tabl 9 we show how these oper were distribut in all queri submit by these user. tabl 9. distribut of queri oper. featur padvanc > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% quot () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00 plu (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90 minu (−) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42 site: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86 avg. num. oper 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49 the distribut of the quot, plu, and minu oper ar similar amongst the four level of padvanc, with quot be the most popular of the four oper us. howev, it appear that the plu oper is the main differenti between the padvanc user group. thi oper, which forc the search engin to includ in the queri term that ar usual exclud by default (e.g. the, a), mai account for some portion of the differ in observ search success.4 howev, thi doe not captur the contribut that each of these oper make to the increas in relev compar with exclud the oper. to gain some insight into thi, we examin the impact that each of the oper had on the relev of retriev result. we focus on queri in padvanc > 0% where the same user had issu a queri without oper and the same queri with oper either befor or afterward. although there were few queri with match pair - and almost all of them contain quot - there wa a small (approxim 10%) increas in the averag relev judgment score assign to document on the trail with quot in the initi queri. it mai be the case that quot queri led to retriev of more relev document, or that thei better match the perceiv need of relev judg and therefor lead to judg document receiv higher score. more analysi similar to [8] is requir to test these proposit further. summari: in thi section we have us sever measur to studi the search success of advanc and non-advanc user. the find of our analysi suggest that advanc search engin user ar more success and have more consist in the relev of the page thei visit. their addit search expertis mai make these user better abl to make better decis about which document to view, mean thei encount consist more relev inform on their search. in addit, within the group of advanc user there is a strong correl between padvanc and the degre of search success. advanc search engin user mai be more adept at combin queri oper to formul power queri statement. we now discuss the find from all three subsect and their implic for the design of improv web search system. 4 it is worth note that there were no signific differ in the distribut of usag of the three search engin - googl, yahoo!, or window live search - amongst advanc search engin user, or between advanc user and non-advanc. 6. discuss and implic our find indic signific differ in the queri, result-click, post-queri navig, and search success of those that us advanc syntax versu those that do not. mani of these find mirror those alreadi found in previou studi with group of self-identifi novic and expert [13][19]. there ar sever wai in which a commerci search engin system might benefit from a quantit indic of searcher expertis. thi might be yet anoth featur avail to a rank engin; i.e. it mai be the case that expert searcher in some case prefer differ page than novic searcher. the user interfac to a search engin might be tailor to a user"s expertis level; perhap even more advanc featur such as term weight and queri expans suggest could be present to more experienc searcher while preserv the simplic of the basic interfac for novic. result present might also be custom base on search skill level; futur work might re-evalu the benefit of content snippet, thumbnail, etc. in a manner that allow differ outcom for differ expertis level. addition, if brows histori ar avail, the destin of advanc searcher could be us as suggest result for queri, bypass and potenti improv upon the tradit search process [10]. the us of the interact of advanc search engin user to guid other with less expertis is an attract proposit for the design of search system. in part, these searcher mai have more post-queri brows expertis that allow them to overcom the shortcom of search system [29]. their interact can be us to point user to place that advanc search engin user visit [32] or simpli to train less experienc searcher how to search more effect. howev, if expert user ar go to be us in thi wai, issu of data sparsiti will need to be overcom. our advanc user onli account for 20.1% of the user whose interact we studi. whilst these mai be amongst the most activ user it is unlik that thei will view document that cover larg number of subject area. howev, rather than focus on where thei go (which is perhap more appropri for those with domain knowledg), advanc search engin user mai us move, tactic and strategi [2] that inexperienc user can learn from. encourag user to us advanc syntax help them learn how to formul better search queri; leverag the search style of expert searcher could help them learn more success post-queri interact. on potenti limit to the result we report is that in prior research, it ha been shown that queri oper do not significantli improv the effect of web search result [8], and that searcher mai be abl to perform just as well without them [27]. it could therefor be argu that the user who do not us queri oper ar in fact more advanc, sinc thei do not wast time us potenti redund syntax in their queri statement. howev, thi seem unlik given that those who us advanc syntax exhibit search behavior typic of user with expertis [13], and ar more success in their search. howev, in futur work we will expand of definit of advanc user beyond attribut of the queri to also includ other interact behavior, some of which we have defin in thi studi, and other avenu of research such as ey-track [12]. 7. conclus in thi paper we have describ a log-base studi of search behavior on the web that ha demonstr that the us of advanc search syntax is correl with other aspect of search behavior such as queri, result clickthrough, post-queri navig, and search success. those that us thi syntax ar activ onlin for longer, spend less time queri and travers search trail, exhibit less deviat in their trail, ar more like to explor search result, take less time to click on result, and ar more success in there search. these ar all trait that we would expect expert searcher to exhibit. crude classif of user base on just on featur that is easili extract from the queri stream yield remark result about the interact behavior of user that do not us the syntax and those that do. as we have suggest, search system mai leverag the interact of these user for improv document rank, page recommend, or even user train. futur work will includ the develop of search interfac and modifi retriev engin that make us of these inform-rich featur, and further investig into the us of these featur as indic of search expertis, includ a cross-correl analysi between result click and post-queri behavior. 8. acknowledg the author ar grate to susan dumai for her thought and construct
