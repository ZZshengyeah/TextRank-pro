a high-accuraci, low-cost local system for wireless sensor network radu stoleru, tian he, john a. stankov, david luebk depart of comput scienc univers of virginia, charlottesvil, va 22903 {stoleru, tianh, stankov, luebk}@cs.virginia.edu abstract the problem of local of wireless sensor node ha long been regard as veri difficult to solv, when consid the realiti of real world environ. in thi paper, we formal describ, design, implement and evalu a novel local system, call spotlight. our system us the spatio-tempor properti of well control event in the network (e.g., light), to obtain the locat of sensor node. we demonstr that a high accuraci in local can be achiev without the aid of expens hardwar on the sensor node, as requir by other local system. we evalu the perform of our system in deploy of mica2 and xsm mote. through perform evalu of a real system deploi outdoor, we obtain a 20cm local error. a sensor network, with ani number of node, deploi in a 2500m2 area, can be local in under 10 minut, us a devic that cost less than $1000. to the best of our knowledg, thi is the first report of a sub-meter local error, obtain in an outdoor environ, without equip the wireless sensor node with special rang hardwar. categori and subject descriptor c.2.4 [comput-commun network]: distribut system; c.3 [special-purpos and applic-base system]: real-time and embed system. gener term algorithm, measur, perform, design, experiment 1. introduct recent, wireless sensor network system have been us in mani promis applic includ militari surveil, habitat monitor, wildlif track etc. [12] [22] [33] [36]. while mani middlewar servic, to support these applic, have been design and implement successfulli, local - find the posit of sensor node - remain on of the most difficult research challeng to be solv practic. sinc most emerg applic base on network sensor node requir locat awar to assist their oper, such as annot sens data with locat context, it is an indispens requir for a sensor node to be abl to find it own locat. mani approach have been propos in the literatur [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], howev it is still not clear how these solut can be practic and econom deploi. an on-board gp [23] is a typic high-end solut, which requir sophist hardwar to achiev high resolut time synchron with satellit. the constraint on power and cost for tini sensor node preclud thi as a viabl solut. other solut requir per node devic that can perform rang among neighbor node. the difficulti of these approach ar  twofold. first, under constraint of form factor and power suppli, the effect rang of such devic ar veri limit. for exampl the effect rang of the ultrason transduc us in the cricket system is less than 2 meter when the sender and receiv ar not face each other [26]. second, sinc most sensor node ar static, i.e. the locat is not expect to chang, it is not cost-effect to equip these sensor with special circuitri just for a on-time local. to overcom these limit, mani rang-free local scheme have been propos. most of these scheme estim the locat of sensor node by exploit the radio connect inform among neighbor node. these approach elimin the need of high-cost special hardwar, at the cost of a less accur local. in addit, the radio propag characterist vari over time and ar environ depend, thu impos high calibr cost for the rang-free local scheme. with such limit in mind, thi paper address the follow research challeng: how to reconcil the need for high accuraci in locat estim with the cost to achiev it. our answer to thi challeng is a local system call spotlight. thi system emploi an asymmetr architectur, in which sensor node do not need ani addit hardwar, other than what thei current have. all the sophist hardwar and comput resid on a singl spotlight devic. the spotlight devic us a steerabl laser light sourc, illumin the sensor node place within a known terrain. we demonstr that thi local is much more accur (i.e., ten of centimet) than the rang-base local scheme and that it ha a much longer effect rang (i.e., thousand of meter) than the solut base on ultra-sound/acoust rang. at the same time, sinc onli a singl sophist devic is need to local the whole network, the amort cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardwar compon to the individu sensor. 2. relat work in thi section, we discuss prior work in local in two major categori: the rang-base local scheme (which us either expens, per node, rang devic for high accuraci, or less accur rang solut, as the receiv signal strength indic (rssi)), and the rang-free scheme, which us onli connect inform (hop-by-hop) as an indic of proxim among the node. the local problem is a fundament research problem in mani domain. in the field of robot, it ha been studi extens [9] [10]. the report local error ar on the order of ten of centimet, when us special rang hardwar, i.e. laser rang finder or ultrasound. due to the high cost and non-neglig form factor of the rang hardwar, these solut can not be simpli appli to sensor network. the rssi ha been an attract solut for estim the distanc between the sender and the receiv. the radar system [2] us the rssi to build a central repositori of signal strength at variou posit with respect to a set of beacon node. the locat of a mobil user is estim within a few meter. in a similar approach, motetrack [17] distribut the refer rssi valu to the beacon node. solut that us rssi and do not requir beacon node have also been propos [5] [14] [24] [26] [29]. thei all share the idea of us a mobil beacon. the sensor node that receiv the beacon, appli differ algorithm for infer their locat. in [29], sichitiu propos a solut in which the node that receiv the beacon construct, base on the rssi valu, a constraint on their posit estim. in [26], priyantha et al. propos mal, a local method in which a mobil node (move strateg) assist in measur distanc between node pair, until the constraint on distanc gener a rigid graph. in [24], pathirana et al. formul the local problem as an on-line estim in a nonlinear dynam system and propos a robust extend kalman filter for solv it. elnahrawi [8] provid strong evid of inher limit of local accuraci us rssi, in indoor environ. a more precis rang techniqu us the time differ between a radio signal and an acoust wave, to obtain pair wise distanc between sensor node. thi approach produc smaller local error, at the cost of addit hardwar. the cricket locat-support system [25] can achiev a locat granular of ten of centimet with short rang ultrasound transceiv. ahlo, propos by savvid et al. [27], emploi time of arriv (toa) rang techniqu that requir extens hardwar and solv rel larg nonlinear system of equat. a similar toa techniqu is emploi in [3]. in [30], simon et al. implement a distribut system (us acoust rang) which locat a sniper in an urban terrain. acoust rang for local is also us by kwon et al. [15]. the report error in local vari from 2.2m to 9.5m, depend on the type (central vs. distribut) of the least squar scale algorithm us. for wireless sensor network rang is a difficult option. the hardwar cost, the energi expenditur, the form factor, the small rang, all ar difficult compromis, and it is hard to envis cheap, unreli and resourc-constraint devic make us of rang-base local solut. howev, the high local accuraci, achiev by these scheme is veri desir. to overcom the challeng pose by the rang-base local scheme, when appli to sensor network, a differ approach ha been propos and evalu in the past. thi approach is call rang-free and it attempt to obtain locat inform from the proxim to a set of known beacon node. bulusu et al. propos in [4] a local scheme, call centroid, in which each node local itself to the centroid of it proxim beacon node. in [13], he et al. propos apit, a scheme in which each node decid it posit base on the possibl of be insid or outsid of a triangl form by ani three beacon node heard by the node. the global coordin system [20], develop at mit, us apriori knowledg of the node densiti in the network, to estim the averag hop distanc. the dv-* famili of local scheme [21], us the hop count from known beacon node to the node in the network to infer the distanc. the major of rang-free local scheme have been evalu in simul, or control environ. sever studi [11] [32] [34] have emphas the challeng that real environ pose. langendoen and reijer present a detail, compar studi of sever local scheme in [16]. to the best of our knowledg, spotlight is the first rang-free local scheme that work veri well in an outdoor environ. our system requir a line of sight between a singl devic and the sensor node, and the map of the terrain where the sensor field is locat. the spotlight system ha a long effect rang (1000"s meter) and doe not requir ani infrastructur or addit hardwar for sensor node. the spotlight system combin the advantag and doe not suffer from the disadvantag of the two local class. 3. spotlight system design the main idea of the spotlight local system is to gener control event in the field where the sensor node were deploi. an event could be, for exampl, the presenc of light in an area. us the time when an event is perceiv by a sensor node and the spatio-tempor properti of the gener event, spatial inform (i.e. locat) regard the sensor node can be infer. figur 1. local of a sensor network us the spotlight system we envis, and depict in figur 1, a sensor network deploy and local scenario as follow: wireless sensor node ar randomli deploi from an unman aerial vehicl. after deploy, the sensor node self-organ into a network and execut a time-synchron protocol. an aerial vehicl (e.g. helicopt), equip with a devic, call spotlight, fli over the network and gener light event. the sensor node detect the event and report back to the spotlight devic, through a base station, the timestamp when the event were detect. the spotlight devic comput the locat of the sensor node. dure the design of our spotlight system, we made the follow assumpt: - the sensor network to be local is connect and a middlewar, abl to forward data from the sensor node to the spotlight devic, is present. - the aerial vehicl ha a veri good knowledg about it posit and orient (6 paramet: 3 translat and 3 rigid-bodi rotat) and it possess the map of the field where the network wa deploi. - a power spotlight devic is avail and it is abl to gener 14 spatial larg event that can be detect by the sensor node, even in the presenc of background nois (daylight). - a line of sight between the spotlight devic and sensor node exist. our assumpt ar simplifi assumpt, meant to reduc the complex of the present, for clariti. we propos solut that do not reli on these simplifi assumpt, in section 6. in order to formal describ and gener the spotlight local system, we introduc the follow definit. 3.1 definit and problem formul let"s assum that the space a ⊂r3 contain all sensor node n, and that each node ni is posit at pi(x, y, z). to obtain pi(x, y, z), a spotlight local system need to support three main function, name an event distribut function (edf) e(t), an event detect function d(e), and a local function l(ti). thei ar formal defin as follow: definit 1: an event e(t, p) is a detect phenomenon that occur at time t and at point p є a. exampl of event ar light, heat, smoke, sound, etc. let ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} be a set of n timestamp of event detect by a node i. let t"={t1", t2", …, tm"} be the set of m timestamp of event gener in the sensor field. definit 2: the event detect function d(e) defin a binari detect algorithm. for a given event e: ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = detectednotiseventfals, detectediseventtru, )( e e ed (1) definit 3: the event distribut function (edf) e(t) defin the point distribut of event within a at time t: }{ trueptedappt =∧∈= )),((|)( (2) definit 4: the local function l(ti) defin a local algorithm with input ti, a sequenc of timestamp of event detect by the node i: i itt i tetl ∈ = )()( (3) figur 2. spotlight system architectur as shown in figur 2, the event detect function d(e) is support by the sensor node. it is us to determin whether an extern event happen or not. it can be implement through either a simpl threshold-base detect algorithm or other advanc digit signal process techniqu. the event distribut e(t) and local function l(ti) ar implement by a spotlight devic. the local function is an aggreg algorithm which calcul the intersect of multipl set of point. the event distribut function e(t) describ the distribut of event over time. it is the core of the spotlight system and it is much more sophist than the other two function. due to the fact that e(t) is realiz by the spotlight devic, the hardwar requir for the sensor node remain minim. with the support of these three function, the local process goe as follow: 1) a spotlight devic distribut event in the space a over a period of time. 2) dure the event distribut, sensor node record the time sequenc ti = {ti1, ti2, …, tin} at which thei detect the event. 3) after the event distribut, each sensor node send the detect time sequenc back to the spotlight devic. 4) the spotlight devic estim the locat of a sensor node i, us the time sequenc ti and the known e(t) function. the event distribut function e(t) is the core techniqu us in the spotlight system and we propos three design for it. these design have differ tradeoff and the cost comparison is present in section 3.5. 3.2 point scan event distribut function to illustr the basic function of a spotlight system, we start with a simpl sensor system where a set of node ar place along a straight line (a = [0, l] r). the spotlight devic gener point event (e.g. light spot) along thi line with constant speed s. the set of timestamp of event detect by a node i is ti={ti1}. the event distribut function e(t) is: ⊂ }{ stpappt *)( =∧∈= (4) where t ∈[0, l/s]. the result local function is: }{ sttetl iii ∗== 11 )()( (5) where d(e(ti1, pi)) = true for node i posit at pi. the implement of the event distribut function e(t) is straightforward. as shown in figur 3(a), when a light sourc emit a beam of light with the angular speed given by d s dt d s )(co 2 αα α == , a light spot event with constant speed s is gener along the line situat at distanc d. figur 3. the implement of the point scan edf the point scan edf can be gener to the case where node ar place in a two dimension plane r2 . in thi case, the spotlight system progress scan the plane to activ the sensor node. thi scenario is depict in figur 3(b). 3.3 line scan event distribut function some devic, e.g. diod laser, can gener an entir line of event simultan. with these devic, we can support the line scan event distribut function easili. we assum that the 15 sensor node ar place in a two dimension plane (a=[l x l] ⊂r2 ) and that the scan speed is s. the set of timestamp of event detect by a node i is ti={ti1, ti2}. figur 4. the implement of the line scan edf the line scan edf is defin as follow: ( ){ ks,*tpl][0,kp(t)e kkx =∧∈= } for t ∈[0, l/s] and: ({ ls*tk,pl][0,kp(t)e kky −=∧∈= )} (6) for t ∈[ l/s, 2l/s]. u )()()( tetet yx= we can local a node by calcul the intersect of the two event line, as shown in figur 4. more formal: i )()()( 21 iii tetetl = (7) where d(e(ti1, pi)) = true, d(e(ti2, pi)) = true for node i posit at pi. 3.4 area cover event distribut function other devic, such as light projector, can gener event that cover an area. thi allow the implement of the area cover edf. the idea of area cover edf is to partit the space a into multipl section and assign a uniqu binari identifi, call code, to each section. let"s suppos that the local is done within a plane (a r2 ). each section sk within a ha a uniqu code k. the area cover edf is then defin as follow: ⊂ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = 0iskofbitjthiffals, 1iskofbitjthiftru, ),( jkbit (8) }{ truetkbitsppt k =∧∈= ),()( and the correspond local algorithm is: { ∧∈=∧== )),(()(|)( iki ttiftruetkbitscogpptl (9)})`),(( itttiffalsetkbit −∈= where cog(sk) denot the center of graviti of sk. we illustr the area cover edf with a simpl exampl. as shown in figur 5, the plane a is divid in 16 section. each section sk ha a uniqu code k. the spotlight devic distribut the event accord to these code: at time j a section sk is cover by an event (lit by light), if jth bit of k is 1. a node resid anywher in the section sk is local at the center of graviti of that section. for exampl, node within section 1010 detect the event at time t = {1, 3}. at t = 4 the section where each node resid can be determin a more accur local requir a finer partit of the plane, henc the number of bit in the code will increas. consid the nois that is present in a real, outdoor environ, it is easi to observ that a rel small error in detect the correct bit pattern could result in a larg local error. return to the exampl shown in figur 5, if a sensor node is locat in the section with code 0000, and due to the nois, at time t = 3, it think it detect an event, it will incorrectli conclud that it code is 1000, and it posit itself two squar below it correct posit. the local accuraci can deterior even further, if multipl error ar present in the transmiss of the code. a natur solut to thi problem is to us error-correct code, which greatli reduc the probabl of an error, without pai the price of a re-transmiss, or lengthen the transmiss time too much. sever error correct scheme have been propos in the past. two of the most notabl on ar the ham (7, 4) code and the golai (23, 12) code. both ar perfect linear error correct code. the ham code scheme can detect up to 2-bit error and correct 1-bit error. in the ham (7, 4) scheme, a messag have 4 bit of data (e.g. dddd, where d is a data bit) is transmit as a 7-bit word by ad 3 error control bit (e.g. dddpdpp, where p is a pariti bit). figur 5. the step of area cover edf. the event cover the shade area. the step of the area cover techniqu, when us ham (7, 4) scheme ar shown in figur 6. golai code can detect up to 6-bit error and correct up to 3-bit error. similar to ham (7, 4), golai construct a 23-bit codeword from 12-bit data. golai code have been us in satellit and spacecraft data transmiss and ar most suitabl in case where short codeword length ar desir. figur 6. the step of area cover edf with ham (7, 4) ecc. the event cover the shade area. let"s assum a 1-bit error probabl of 0.01, and a 12-bit messag that need to be transmit. the probabl of a fail transmiss is thu: 0.11, if no error detect and correct is us; 0.0061 for the ham scheme (i.e. more than 1-bit error); and 0.000076 for the golai scheme (i.e. more than 3-bit error). golai is thu 80 time more robust that the ham scheme, which is 20 time more robust than the no error correct scheme. 16 consid that a limit number of correct is possibl by ani code scheme, a natur question aris: can we minim the local error when there ar error that can not be correct? thi can be achiev by a clever placement of code in the grid. as shown in figur 7, the placement a, in the presenc of a 1-bit error ha a smaller averag local error when compar to the placement b. the object of our code placement strategi is to reduc the total euclidean distanc between all pair of code with ham distanc smaller than k, the largest number of expect 1-bit error. figur 7. differ code placement strategi formal, a placement is repres by a function p: [0, l]d → c, which assign a code to everi coordin in the d-dimension cube of size l (e.g., in the planar case, we place code in a  2dimension grid). we denot by de(i, j) the euclidean distanc and by dh(i, j) the ham distanc between two code i and j. in a noisi environ, dh(i,j) determin the crossov probabl between the two code. for the case of independ detect, the higher dh(i, j) is, the lower the crossov probabl will be. the object function is defin as follow: d kjid e ljiwherejid h ],0[,}),(min{ ),( ∈∑≤ (10) equat 10 is a non-linear and non-convex program problem. in gener, it is analyt hard to obtain the global minimum. to overcom thi, we propos a greedi placement method to obtain suboptim result. in thi method we initi the 2-dimension grid with code. then we swap the code within the grid repeatedli, to minim the object function. for each swap, we greedili chose a pair of code, which can reduc the object function (equat 10) the most. the propos greedi placement method end when no swap of code can further minim the object function. for evalu, we compar the averag local error in the presenc of k-bit error for two strategi: the propos greedi placement and the row-major placement (it place the code consecut in the arrai, in row-first order). 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3

detect/correct capabl is present and 1-bit error occur, then our greedi placement method can reduc the local error by an averag 23%, when compar to the row-major placement. if error detect and correct scheme ar us (e.g. ham (12, 8) and if 3-bit error occur (k=3) then the greedi placement method reduc local error by 12%, when compar to the row-major placement, as shown in figur 9. if k=1, then there is no benefit in us the greedi placement method, sinc the 1-bit error can be correct by the ham scheme. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 grid size localizationerror[gridunit]

node, thei differ in the local time, commun overhead and energi consum by the event distribut function (let"s call it event overhead). let"s assum that all sensor node ar locat in a squar with edg size d, and that the spotlight devic can gener n event (e.g. point, line and area cover event) everi second and that the maximum toler local error is r. tabl 1 present the execut cost comparison of the three differ spotlight techniqu. tabl 1. execut cost comparison criterion point scan line scan area cover local time nrd /)/( 22 nrd /)/2( ndlogr / # detect 1 2 logrd # time stamp 1 2 logrd event overhead d2 2d2 d2 logrd/2 tabl 1 indic that the event overhead for the point scan method is the smallest - it requir a on-time coverag of the area, henc the d2 . howev the point scan take a much longer time than the area cover techniqu, which finish in logrd second. the line scan method trade the event overhead well with the local time. by doubl the event overhead, the line scan method take onli r/2d percentag of time to complet, when compar with the point scan method. from tabl 1, it can be observ that the execut cost do not depend on the number of sensor node to be local. it is import to remark the ratio event overhead per unit time, which is indic of the power requir for the spotlight devic. thi ratio is constant for the point scan (r2 *n) while it grow linearli with area, for the area cover (d2 *n/2). if the deploy area is veri larg, the us of the area cover edf is prohibit expens, if not imposs. for practic purpos, the area cover is a viabl solut for small to medium size network, while the line scan work well for larg network. we discuss the implic of the power requir for the spotlight devic, and offer a hybrid solut in section 6. 3.6 local error analysi the accuraci of local with the spotlight techniqu depend on mani aspect. the major factor that were consid dure the implement of the system ar discuss below: 17 - time synchron: the spotlight system exchang time stamp between sensor node and the spotlight devic. it is necessari for the system to reach consensu on global time through synchron. due to the uncertainti in hardwar process and wireless commun, we can onli confin such error within certain bound (e.g. on jiffi). an imprecis input to the local function l(t) lead to an error in node local. - uncertainti in detect: the sampl rate of the sensor node is finit, consequ, there will be an unpredict delai between the time when an event is truli present and when the sensor node detect it. lower sampl rate will gener larger local error. - size of the event: the event distribut by the spotlight devic can not be infinit small. if a node detect on event, it is hard for it to estim the exact locat of itself within the event. - realiz of event distribut function: edf defin locat of event at time t. due to the limit accuraci (e.g. mechan imprecis), a spotlight devic might gener event which locat differ from where these event ar suppos to be. it is import to remark that the local error is independ of the number of sensor node in the network. thi independ, as well as the aforement independ of the execut cost, indic the veri good scalabl properti (with the number of sensor node, but not with the area of deploy) that the spotlight system possess. 4. system implement for our perform evalu we implement two spotlight system. us these two implement we were abl to investig the full spectrum of event distribut techniqu, propos in section 3, at a reduc on time cost (less than $1,000). the first implement, call μspotlight, had a short rang (10-20 meter), howev it capabl of gener the entir spectrum of edf made it veri us. we us thi implement mainli to investig the capabl of the spotlight system and tune it perform. it wa not intend to repres the full solut, but onli a scale down version of the system. the second implement, the spotlight system, had a much longer rang (as far as 6500m), but it wa limit in the type of edf that it can gener. the goal of thi implement wa to show how the spotlight system work in a real, outdoor environ, and show correl with the experiment result obtain from the μspotlight system implement. in the remain part of thi section, we describ how we implement the three compon (event distribut, event detect and local function) of the spotlight architectur, and the time synchron protocol, a kei compon of our system. 4.1 µspotlight system the first system we built, call μspotlight, us as the spotlight devic, an infocu ld530 projector connect to an ibm thinkpad laptop. the system is shown in figur 10. the event distribut function wa implement as a java gui. due to the stringent time requir and the delai caus by the buffer in the window system of a pc, we us the full-screen exclus mode api provid by java2. thi allow us to bypass the window system and more precis estim the time when an event is displai by the projector, henc a higher accuraci of timestamp of event. becaus of the 50hz refresh rate of our projector, there wa still an uncertainti in the time stamp of the event of 20msec. we explor the possibl of us and modifi the linux kernel to expos the vertic synch (vsynch) interrupt, gener by the displai devic after each screen refresh, out of the kernel mode. the perform evalu result show, howev, that thi level of accuraci wa not need. the sensor node that we us were berkelei mica2 mote equip with mt310 multi-sensor board from crossbow. thi sensor board contain a cdse photo sensor which can detect the light from the projector. figur 10. μspotlight system implement with thi implement of the spotlight system, we were abl to gener point, line and area scan event. 4.2 spotlight system the second spotlight system we built us, as the spotlight devic, diod laser, a computer telescop mount (celestron cg-5gt, shown in figur 11), and an ibm thinkpad laptop. the laptop wa connect, through rs232 interfac, to the telescop mount and to on xsm600ca [7] mote, act as a base station. the diod laser we us rang in power from 7mw to 35mw. thei emit at 650nm, close to the point of highest sensit for cdse photosensor. the diod laser were equip with lens that allow us to control the diverg of the beam. figur 11. spotlight system implement the telescop mount ha worm gear for a smooth motion and high precis angular measur. the two angular measur that we us were the, so call, alt (from altitud) and az (from azimuth). in astronomi, the altitud of a celesti object is it angular distanc abov or below the celesti horizon, and the azimuth is the angular distanc of an object eastward of the meridian, along the horizon. 18 the laptop comput, through a java gui, control the motion of the telescop mount, orient it such that a full point scan of an area is perform, similar to the on describ in figur 3(b). for each turn point i, the 3-tupl (alti and azi angl and the timestamp ti) is record. the spotlight system us the timestamp receiv from a sensor node j, to obtain the angular measur altj and azj for it locat. for the sensor node, we us xsm mote, mainli becaus of their longer commun rang. the xsm mote ha the photo sensor embed in it main board. we had to make minor adjust to the plastic hous, in order to expos the photo sensor to the outsid. the same mote code, written in nesc, for tinyo, wa us for both µspotlight and spotlight system implement. 4.3 event detect function d(t) the event detect function aim to detect the begin of an event and record the time when the event wa observ. we implement a veri simpl detect function base on the observ maximum valu. an event i will be time stamp with time ti, if the read from the photo sensor dti, fulfil the condit: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum valu report by the photo sensor befor ti and Δ is a constant which ensur that the first larg detect give the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variat around the first larg signal ar not consid). henc Δ guarante that onli sharp chang in the detect valu gener an observ event. 4.4 local function l(t) the local function is implement in the java gui. it match the timestamp creat by the event distribut function with those report by the sensor node. the local function for the point scan edf ha as input a time sequenc ti = {t1}, as report by node i. the function perform a simpl search for the event with a timestamp closest to t1. if t1 is

local function is the time sequenc ti = {t1, t2} as report by node i. if the report timestamp ar constrain by: 11 + << nn ee ttt , and 12 + << mm ee ttt where en and en+1 ar two consecut event on the horizont scan and em and em+1 ar two consecut event on vertic scan, then the infer locat for node i is: 11 , ++ == mn ee yyxx the local function for the area cover edf ha as input a timestamp set ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} of the n event, detect by node i. we recal the notat for the set of m timestamp of event gener by the spotlight devic, t"={t1", t2", …, tm"}. a code di=di1di2…dim is then construct for each node i, such that dij=1 if tj" ∈ti and dij=0 if tj" ∉ ti. the function perform a search for an event with an ident code. if the follow condit is true: nei dd = where en is an event with code den, then the infer locat for node i is: nn ee yyxx == , 4.5 time synchron the time synchron in the spotlight system consist of two part: - synchron between sensor node: thi is achiev through the flood time synchron protocol [18]. in thi protocol, synchron node (the root node is the onli synchron node at the begin) send time synchron messag to unsynchron node. the sender put the time stamp into the synchron messag right befor the byte contain the time stamp ar transmit. onc a receiv get the messag, it follow the sender's time and perform the necessari calcul to compens for the clock drift. - synchron between the sensor node and the spotlight devic: we implement thi part through a two-wai handshak between the spotlight devic and on node, us as the base station. the sensor node is attach to the spotlight devic through a serial interfac. figur 12. two-wai synchron as shown in figur 12, let"s assum that the spotlight devic send a synchron messag (sync) at local time t1, the sensor node receiv it at it local time t2 and acknowledg it at local time t3 (both t2 and t3 ar sent back through ack). after the spotlight devic receiv the ack, at it local time t4, the time synchron can be achiev as follow: 2 )()( 4312 tttt offset −+− = (11) offsetttt spotlightnodeglob +== we note that equat 11 assum that the on trip delai ar the same in both direct. in practic thi doe not hold well enough. to improv the perform, we separ the handshak process from the timestamp exchang. the handshak is done fast, through a 2 byte exchang between the spotlight devic and the sensor node (the timestamp ar still record, but not sent). after thi fast handshak, the record time stamp ar exchang. the result indic that thi approach can significantli improv the accuraci of time synchron. 5. perform evalu in thi section we present the perform evalu of the spotlight system when us the three event distribut function, i.e. point scan, line scan and area cover, describ in section 3. 19 for the µspotlight system we us 10 mica2 mote. the sensor node were attach to a vertic posit veltex board. by project the light to the sensor node, we ar abl to gener well control point, line and area event. the spotlight devic wa abl to gener event, i.e. project light pattern, cover an area of approxim size 180x140cm2 . the screen resolut for the projector wa 1024x768, and the movement of the point scan and line scan techniqu wa done through increment (in the appropri direct) of 10 pixel between event. each experiment point wa obtain from 10 success run of the local procedur. each set of 10 run wa preced by a calibr phase, aim at estim the total delai (between the spotlight devic and each sensor node) in detect an event. dure the calibr, we creat an event cover the entir sensor field (illumin the entir area). the timestamp report by each sensor node, in conjunct with the timestamp creat by the spotlight devic were us to obtain the time offset, for each sensor node. more sophist calibr procedur have been report previous [35]. in addit to the time offset, we ad a manual configur paramet, call bia. it wa us to best estim the center of an event. figur 13. deploy site for the spotlight system for the spotlight system evalu, we deploi 10 xsm mote in a footbal field. the site is shown in figur 13 (laser beam ar depict with red arrow and sensor node with white dot). two set of experi were run, with the spotlight devic posit at 46m and at 170m from the sensor field. the sensor node were align and the spotlight devic execut a point scan. the local system comput the coordin of the sensor node, and the spotlight devic wa orient, through a goto command sent to the telescop mount, toward the comput locat. in the initi stage of the experi, we manual measur the local error. for our experiment evalu, the metric of interest were as follow: - local error, defin as the distanc, between the real locat and the on obtain from the spotlight system. - local durat, defin as the time span between the first and last event. - local rang, defin as the maximum distanc between the spotlight devic and the sensor node. - a local cost function cost:{{local accuraci}, {local durat}} → [0,1] quantifi the trade-off between the accuraci in local and the local durat. the object is to minim the local cost function. by denot with ei the local error for the ith scenario, with di the local durat for the ith scenario, with max(e) the maximum local error, with max(d) the maximum local durat, and with α the import factor, the local cost function is formal defin as: )max( )1( )max( ),( d d e e decost ii ii ∗−+∗= αα - local bia. thi metric is us to investig the effect of the calibr procedur. if, for exampl, all comput locat have a bia in the west direct, a calibr factor can be us to compens for the differ. the paramet that we vari dure the perform evalu of our system were: the type of scan (point, line and area), the size of the event, the durat of the event (for area cover), the scan speed, the power of the laser and the distanc between the spotlight devic and sensor field, to estim the rang of the system. 5.1 point scan - μspotlight system in thi experi, we investig how the size of the event and the scan speed affect the local error. figur 14 show the mean local error with their standard deviat. it can be observ, that while the scan speed, vari between 35cm/sec and 87cm/sec ha a minor influenc on the local accuraci, the size of the event ha a dramat effect. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 21.0 24.5 event size [cm] locationerror[cm] 87cm/sec

our event detect algorithm: the first detect abov a threshold gave the timestamp for the event. the durat of the local scheme is shown in figur 15. the depend of the local durat on the size of the event and scan speed is natur. a bigger event allow a reduct in the total durat of up to 70%. the local durat is directli proport to the scan speed, as expect, and depict in figur 15. 0 20 40 60 80

between the local accuraci (usual the most import factor), and the local time (import in environ where stealthi is paramount). figur 16 show the local cost function, for α = 0.5 (accuraci and durat ar equal import). as shown in figur 16, it can be observ that an event size of approxim 10-15cm (depend on the scan speed) minim our cost function. for α = 1, the same graph would be a monoton increas function, while for α = 0, it would be monoton decreas function. 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 event size [cm] localizationcost[%] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec figur 16. local cost vs. event size for the point scan edf 5.2 line scan - μspotlight system in a similar manner to the point scan edf, for the line scan edf we were interest in the depend of the local error and durat on the size of the event and scan speed. we repres in figur 17 the local error for differ event size. it is interest to observ the depend (concav shape) of the local error vs. the event size. moreov, a question that should aris is why the same depend wa not observ in the case of point scan edf. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 event size [cm] locationerror[cm] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec figur 17. local error vs. event size for the line scan edf the explan for thi concav depend is the exist of a bia in locat estim. as a remind, a bia factor wa introduc in order to best estim the central point of event that have a larg size. what figur 17 show is the fact that the bia factor wa optim for an event size of approxim 7cm. for event smaller and larger than thi, the bia factor wa too larg, and too small, respect. thu, it introduc bias error in the posit estim. the reason why we did not observ the same depend in the case of the point scan edf wa that we did not experi with event size below 7cm, due to the long time it would have taken to scan the entir field with event as small as 1.7cm. the result for the local durat as a function of the size of the event ar shown in figur 18. as shown, the local durat is directli proport to the scan speed. the size of the event ha a smaller influenc on the local durat. on can remark the averag local durat of about 10sec, much shorter then the durat obtain in the point scan experi. the local cost function depend on the event size and scan speed, for α=0.5, is shown in figur 19. the depend on the scan speed is veri small (the cost function achiev a minimum in the same 4-6cm rang). it is interest to note that thi 4-6cm optim event size is smaller than the on observ in the case of point scan edf. the explan for thi is that the smaller local durat observ in the line scan edf, allow a shift (toward smaller event size) in the total local cost function. 0 5 10 15 20 1.7 3.5 7.0

a bia in locat estim. the estim locat for all sensor node exhibit differ bias, for differ event size. for exampl, for an event size of 17.5cm, the estim locat for sensor node wa to the upper-left size of the actual locat. thi wa equival to an earli detect, sinc our scan wa done from left to right and from top to bottom. the scan speed did not influenc the bia. in order to better understand the observ phenomena, we analyz our data. figur 20 show the bia in the horizont direct, for differ event size (the vertic bia wa almost ident, and we omit it, due to space constraint). from figur 20, on can observ that the smallest observ bia, and henc the most accur posit, wa for an event of size 7cm. these result ar consist with the observ local error, shown in figur 17. we also adjust the measur local error (shown in figur 17) for the observ bia (shown in figur 20). the result of an ideal case of spotlight local system with line scan edf ar shown in figur 21. the error ar remark small, vari between 0.1cm and 0.8cm, with a gener trend of higher local error for larger event size. 21 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 event size [cm] horizontalbia[cm] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec

accuraci. in our first experi we did not us error correct code. the result ar shown in figur 22. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 6 8 10 12 number of bit locationerror[cm] 20ms/event 40ms/event

the varianc in the local error. in the scenario where 12 bit were us, while the averag error wa veri small, there were a coupl of case, where an incorrect event detect gener a larger than expect error. an exampl of how thi error can occur wa describ in section 3.4. the experiment result, present in figur 22, emphas the need for error correct of the bit pattern observ and report by the sensor node. the local durat result ar shown in figur 23. it can be observ that the durat is directli proport with the number of bit us, with total durat rang from 3sec, for the least accur method, to 6-7sec for the most accur. the durat of an event had a small influenc on the total local time, when consid the same scenario (same number of bit for the code). the cost function depend on the number of bit in the code, for α=0.5, is shown in figur 24. gener, sinc the local durat for the area scan can be extrem small, a higher accuraci in the local is desir. while the cost function achiev a minimum when

locat estim algorithm. the experiment result ar depict in figur 25, and show a consist accuraci. the scenario without error correct code, is simpli the same 12-bit code scenario, shown in figur 22. we onli investig the 12-bit scenario, due to it match with the  12bit data requir by the golai encod scheme (extend golai produc 24-bit codeword). 22 5.4 point scan - spotlight system in thi section we describ the experi perform at a footbal stadium, us our spotlight system. the hardwar that we had avail allow us to evalu the point scan techniqu of the spotlight system. in our evalu, we were interest to see the perform of the system at differ rang. figur 26 and 27 show the local error versu the event size at two differ rang: 46m and 170m. figur 26 show a remark accuraci in local. the error ar in the centimet rang. our initi, manual measur of the local error were most of the time difficult to make, sinc the spot of the laser wa almost perfectli cover the xsm mote. we ar abl to achiev local error of a few centimet, which onli rang-base local scheme ar abl to achiev [25]. the observ depend on the size of the event is similar to the on observ in the μspotlight system evalu, and shown in figur 14. thi prove that the μspotlight system is a viabl altern for investig complex edf, without incur the cost for the necessari hardwar. 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 event size

the spotlight system oper over the length of a footbal stadium. throughout our experiment with the spotlight system, we have observ local error that were simpli offset of real locat. sinc the same phenomenon wa observ when experi with the μspotlight system, we believ that with auto-calibr, the local error can be further reduc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 6 12 18 event size [cm] localizationerror[cm]

and l ar the dimens of the sensor network field, s is the scan speed, and es is the size of the event. figur 28 show the time for local a sensor network deploi in an area of size of a footbal field us the spotlight system. here we ignor the messag propag time, from the sensor node to the spotlight devic. from figur 28 it can be observ that the veri small local error ar prohibit expens in the case of the point scan. when local error of up to 1m ar toler, local durat can be as low as 4 minut. local durat of 5-10 minut, and local error of 1m ar current state of art in the realm of rang-free local scheme. and these result ar achiev by us the point scan scheme, which requir the highest local time, as it wa shown in tabl 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 event size [cm] localizationtim[min] 3m/sec 6m/sec 9m/sec figur 28. local time vs. event size for spotlight system on import characterist of the spotlight system is it rang. the two most import factor ar the sensit of the photosensor and the power of the spotlight sourc. we were interest in measur the rang of our spotlight system, consid our capabl (mt310 sensor board and inexpens, $12-$85, diod laser). as a result, we measur the intens of the laser beam, have the same focu, at differ distanc. the result ar shown in figur 29. 950 1000 1050 1100 0 50 100 150 200 distanc [m] intens[adccount] 35mw 7mw figur 29. local rang for the spotlight system from figur 29, it can be observ that onli a minor decreas in the intens occur, due to absorpt and possibl our imperfect focus of the laser beam. a linear fit of the experiment data show that distanc of up to 6500m can be achiev. while we do not expect atmospher condit, over larg distanc, to be similar to our 200m evalu, there is strong evid that distanc (i.e. altitud) of 1000-2000m can easili be achiev. the angl between the laser beam and the vertic should be minim (less than 45°), as it reduc the differ between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual project of the beam on the ground. in a similar manner, we were interest in find out the maximum size of an event, that can be gener by a cot laser and that is detect by the exist photosensor. for thi, we 23 vari the diverg of the laser beam and measur the light intens, as given by the adc count. the result ar shown in figur 30. it can be observ that for the less power laser, an event size of 1.5m is the limit. for the more power laser, the event size can be as high as 4m. through our extens perform evalu result, we have shown that the spotlight system is a feasibl, highli accur, low cost solut for local of wireless sensor network. from our experi with sourc of laser radiat, we believ that for small and medium size sensor network deploy, in area of less than 20,000m2 , the area cover scheme is a viabl solut. for larg size sensor network deploy, the line scan, or an increment us of the area cover ar veri good option. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 event size

system can be consid central, due to the gather of the sensor data and the execut of the local function l(t) by the spotlight devic. we show that thi design can easili be transform into a distribut on, by offer two solut. on idea is to dissemin in the network, inform about the path of event, gener by the edf (similar to an equat, describ a path), and let the sensor node execut the local function. for exampl, in the line scan scenario, if the start and end point for the horizont and vertic scan, and the time thei were reach, ar propag in the network, then ani sensor in the network can obtain it locat (assum a constant scan speed). a second solut is to us anchor node which know their posit. in the case of line scan, if three anchor ar present, after detect the presenc of the two event, the anchor flood the network with their locat and time of detect. us the same simpl formula as in the previou scheme, all sensor node can infer their posit. 6.2 local overhead reduct anoth requir impos by the spotlight system design, is the us of a time synchron protocol between the spotlight devic and the sensor network. relax thi requir and impos onli a time synchron protocol among sensor node is a veri desir object. the idea is to us the knowledg that the spotlight devic ha about the speed with which the scan of the sensor field take place. if the scan speed is constant (let"s call it s), then the time differ (let"s call it Δt) between the event detect of two sensor node is, in fact, an accur measur of the rang between them: d=s*Δt. henc, the spotlight system can be us for accur rang of the distanc between ani pair of sensor node. an import observ is that thi rang techniqu doe not suffer from limit of other: small rang and direction for ultrasound, or irregular, fade and multipath for receiv signal strength indic (rssi). after the rang between node have been determin (either in a central or distribut manner) graph embed algorithm can be us for a realiz of a rigid graph, describ the sensor network topolog. 6.3 dynam event distribut function e(t) anoth system optim is for environ where the sensor node densiti is not uniform. on disadvantag of the line scan techniqu, when compar to the area cover, is the local time. an idea is to us two scan: on which us a larg event size (henc larger local error), follow by a second scan in which the event size chang dynam. the first scan is us for identifi the area with a higher densiti of sensor node. the second scan us a larger event in area where the sensor node densiti is low and a smaller event in area with a higher sensor node densiti. a dynam edf can also be us when it is veri difficult to meet the power requir for the spotlight devic (impos by the us of the area cover scheme in a veri larg area). in thi scenario, a hybrid scheme can be us: the first scan (point scan) is perform quickli, with a veri larg event size, and it is meant to identifi, roughli, the locat of the sensor network. subsequ area cover scan will be execut on smaller portion of the network, until the entir deploy area is local. 6.4 stealthi our implement of the spotlight system us visibl light for creat event. us the system dure the daylight or in a room well lit, pose challeng due to the solar or fluoresc lamp radiat, which gener a strong background nois. the altern, which we us in our perform evalu, wa to us the system in a dark room (μspotlight system) or dure the night (spotlight system). while us the spotlight system dure the night is a good solut for environ where stealthi is not import (e.g. environment scienc) for other (e.g. militari applic), divulg the presenc and locat of a sensor field, could serious compromis the efficaci of the system. figur 31. fluoresc light spectra (top), spectral respons for cdse cell (bottom) a solut to thi problem, which we experi with in the µspotlight system, wa to us an optic filter on top of the light 24 sensor. the spectral respons of a cdse photo sensor span almost the entir visibl domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (figur 31-bottom). as shown in figur 31-top, the fluoresc light ha no signific compon abov 700nm. henc, a simpl red filter (schott rg-630), which transmit all light with wavelength approxim abov 630nm, coupl with an event distribut function that gener event with wavelength abov the same threshold, would allow the us of the system when a fluoresc light is present. a solut for the spotlight system to be stealthi at night, is to us a sourc of infra-red radiat (i.e. laser) emit in the rang [750, 1000]nm. for a daylight us of the spotlight system, the challeng is to overcom the strong background of the natur light. a solut we ar consid is the us of a narrow-band optic filter, center at the wavelength of the laser radiat. the feasibl and the cost-effect of thi solut remain to be proven. 6.5 network deploi in unknown terrain a further gener is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network wa deploi is unknown. while thi is highli unlik for mani civil applic of wireless sensor network technolog, it is not difficult to imagin militari applic where the sensor network is deploi in a hostil and unknown terrain. a solut to thi problem is a system that us two spotlight devic, or equival, the us of the same devic from two distinct posit, execut, from each of them, a complet local procedur. in thi scheme, the posit of the sensor node is uniqu determin by the intersect of the two locat direct obtain by the system. the rel local (for each pair of spotlight devic) will requir an accur knowledg of the 3 translat and 3 rigid-bodi rotat paramet for spotlight"s posit and orient (as mention in section 3). thi gener is also applic to scenario where, due to terrain variat, there is no singl aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor node, e.g. hilli terrain. by execut the local procedur from differ aerial point, the probabl of establish a line of sight with all the node, increas. for some militari scenario [1] [12], where open terrain is preval, the exist of a line of sight is not a limit factor. in light of thi, the spotlight system can not be us in forest or indoor environ. 7. conclus and futur work in thi paper we present the design, implement and evalu of a local system for wireless sensor network, call spotlight. our local solut doe not requir ani addit hardwar for the sensor node, other than what alreadi exist. all the complex of the system is encapsul into a singl spotlight devic. our local system is reusabl, i.e. the cost can be amort through sever deploy, and it perform is not affect by the number of sensor node in the network. our experiment result, obtain from a real system deploi outdoor, show that the local error is less than 20cm. thi error is current state of art, even for rang-base local system and it is 75% smaller than the error obtain when us gp devic or when the manual deploy of sensor node is a feasibl option [31]. as futur work, we would like to explor the self-calibr and self-tune of the spotlight system. the accuraci of the system can be further improv if the distribut of the event, instead of a singl timestamp, is report. a gener could be obtain by reformul the problem as an angular estim problem that provid the build block for more gener local techniqu. 8. acknowledg thi work wa support by the darpa ixo offic, under the nest
