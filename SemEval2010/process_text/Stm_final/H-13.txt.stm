the influenc of caption featur on clickthrough pattern in web search charl l. a. clark eugen agichtein susan dumai and ryen w. white univers of waterloo emori univers microsoft research abstract web search engin present list of caption, compris  titl, snippet, and url, to help user decid which search result to visit. understand the influenc of featur of these caption on web search behavior mai help valid algorithm and guidelin for their improv gener. in thi paper we develop a methodolog to us clickthrough log from a commerci search engin to studi user behavior when interact with search result caption. the find of our studi suggest that rel simpl caption featur such as the presenc of all term queri term, the  readabl of the snippet, and the length of the url shown in the caption, can significantli influenc user" web search  behavior. categori and subject descriptor h.3.3 [inform storag and retriev]: inform search and retriev-search process gener term experiment, human factor 1. introduct the major commerci web search engin all present their result in much the same wai. each search result is describ by a brief caption, compris the url of the  associ web page, a titl, and a brief summari (or  snippet) describ the content of the page. often the snippet is extract from the web page itself, but it mai also be taken from extern sourc, such as the human-gener summari found in web directori. figur 1 show a typic web search, with caption for the top three result. while the three caption share the same basic structur, their content differ in sever respect. the snippet of the third caption is nearli twice as long as that of the first, while the snippet is miss entir from the second caption. the titl of the third caption contain all of the queri term in order, while the titl of the first and second caption contain onli two of the three term. on of the queri term is repeat in the first caption. all of the queri term appear in the url of the third caption, while none appear in the url of the first caption. the snippet of the first caption consist of a complet sentenc that  concis describ the associ page, while the snippet of the third caption consist of two incomplet sentenc that ar larg unrel to the overal content of the associ page and to the appar intent of the queri. while these differ mai seem minor, thei mai also have a substanti impact on user behavior. a princip motiv for provid a caption is to assist the user in determin the relev of the associ page without actual have to click through to the result. in the case of a navig queri - particularli when the destin is well known - the url alon mai be suffici to identifi the desir page. but in the case of an inform queri, the titl and snippet mai be necessari to guid the user in select a page for further studi, and she mai judg the relev of a page on the basi of the caption alon. when thi judgment is correct, it can speed the search process by allow the user to avoid unwant materi. when it fail, the user mai wast her time click through to an inappropri result and scan a page contain littl or noth of interest. even wors, the user mai be misl into skip a page that contain desir  inform. all three of the result in figur 1 ar relev, with some limit. the first result link to the main yahoo kid! homepag, but it is then necessari to follow a link in a menu to find the main page for game. despit appear, the second result link to a surprisingli larg collect of  onlin game, primarili with environment theme. the third result might be somewhat disappoint to a user, sinc it lead to onli a singl game, host at the center for diseas control, that could not reason be describ as onlin. unfortun, these page characterist ar not entir  reflect in the caption. in thi paper, we examin the influenc of caption  featur on user"s web search behavior, us clickthrough extract from search engin log as our primari  investig tool. understand thi influenc mai help to valid algorithm and guidelin for the improv gener of the figur 1: top three result for the queri: kid onlin game. caption themselv. in addit, these featur can plai a role in the process of infer relev judgment from user behavior [1]. by better understand their influenc, better judgment mai result. differ caption gener algorithm might select  snippet of differ length from differ area of a page.  snippet mai be gener in a queri-independ fashion,  provid a summari of the page as a whole, or in a  querydepend fashion, provid a summari of how the page relat to the queri term. the correct choic of snippet mai depend on aspect of both the queri and the result page. the titl mai be taken from the html header or extract from the bodi of the document [8]. for link that re-direct, it mai be possibl to displai altern url. moreov, for page list in human-edit web directori such as the open directori project1 , it mai be possibl to displai altern titl and snippet deriv from these list. when these altern snippet, titl and url ar  avail, the select of an appropri combin for displai mai be guid by their featur. a snippet from a web  directori mai consist of complet sentenc and be less  fragmentari than an extract snippet. a titl extract from the bodi mai provid greater coverag of the queri term. a url befor re-direct mai be shorter and provid a clearer idea of the final destin. the work report in thi paper wa undertaken in the context of the window live search engin. the imag in  figur 1 wa captur from window live and crop to  elimin brand, advertis and navig element. the experi report in later section ar base on  window live queri log, result page and relev judgment collect as part of ongo research into search engin  perform [1,2]. nonetheless, given the similar of caption format across the major web search engin we believ the result ar applic to these other engin. the queri in 1 www.dmoz.org figur 1 produc result with similar relev on the other major search engin. thi and other queri produc  caption that exhibit similar variat. in addit, we believ our methodolog mai be gener to other search  applic when suffici clickthrough data is avail. 2. relat work while commerci web search engin have follow  similar approach to caption displai sinc their genesi,  rel littl research ha been publish about method for gener these caption and evalu their impact on user behavior. most relat research in the area of document summar ha focus on newspap articl and  similar materi, rather than web page, and ha conduct  evalu by compar automat gener summari with manual gener summari. most research on the displai of web result ha propos substanti interfac chang, rather than address detail of the exist  interfac. 2.1 displai of web result varadarajan and hristidi [16] ar among the few who have attempt to improv directli upon the snippet  gener by commerci search system, without introduc addit chang to the interfac. thei gener  snippet from span tree of document graph and  experiment compar these snippet against the snippet  gener for the same document by the googl desktop search system and msn desktop search system. thei evalu their method by ask user to compar snippet from the variou sourc. cutrel and guan [4] conduct an ey-track studi to investig the influenc of snippet length on web search perform and found that the optim snippet length  vari accord to the task type, with longer snippet lead to improv perform for inform task and shorter snippet for navig task. mani research have explor altern method for displai web search result. dumai et al. [5] compar an interfac typic of those us by major web search engin with on that group result by categori, find that user perform search task faster with the categori interfac. paek et al. [12] propos an interfac base on a fishey len, in which mous hover and other event caus caption to zoom and snippet to expand with addit text. white et al. [17] evalu three altern to the  standard web search interfac: on that displai expand  summari on mous hover, on that displai a list of top  rank sentenc extract from the result taken as a group, and on that updat thi list automat through  implicit feedback. thei treat the length of time that a user spend view a summari as an implicit indic of  relev. their goal wa to improv the abil of user to interact with a given result set, help them to look  beyond the first page of result and to reduc the burden of queri re-formul. 2.2 document summar outsid the narrow context of web search consider  relat research ha been undertaken on the problem of  document summar. the basic idea of extract  summar - creat a summari by select sentenc or fragment - goe back to the foundat work of luhn [11]. luhn"s approach us term frequenc to identifi  signific word within a document and then select and extract sentenc that contain signific word in close proxim. a consider fraction of later work mai be view as extend and tune thi basic approach, develop  improv method for identifi signific word and  select sentenc. for exampl, a recent paper by sun et al. [14] describ a variant of luhn"s algorithm that us clickthrough data to identifi signific word. at it  simplest, snippet gener for web caption might also be view as follow thi approach, with queri term take on the role of signific word. sinc 2000, the annual document understand  confer (duc) seri, conduct by the us nation institut of standard and technolog, ha provid a vehicl for evalu much of the research in document  summar2 . each year duc defin a methodolog for on or more experiment task, and suppli the necessari test document, human-creat summari, and automat extract baselin summari. the major of  particip system us extract summar, but a number attempt natur languag gener and other approach. evalu at duc is achiev through comparison with manual gener summari. over the year duc ha includ both singl-document summar and  multidocu summar task. the main duc 2007 task is pose as take place in a question answer context. given a topic and 25 document, particip were ask to gener a 250-word summari satisfi the inform need enbodi in the topic. we view our approach of  evalu summar through the analysi of web log as complement the approach taken at duc. a number of other research have examin the valu of queri-depend summar in a non-web context. tombro and sanderson [15] compar the perform of 20 subject search a collect of newspap articl when 2 duc.nist.gov guid by queri-independ vs. queri-depend snippet. the queri-independ snippet were creat by extract the first few sentenc of the articl; the queri-depend snippet were creat by select the highest score  sentenc under a measur bias toward sentenc contain queri term. when queri-depend summari were  present, subject were better abl to identifi relev  document without click through to the full text. goldstein et al. [6] describ anoth extract system for gener queri-depend summari from newspap  articl. in their system, sentenc ar rank by combin statist and linguist featur. thei introduc  normal measur of recal and precis to facilit evalu. 2.3 clickthrough queri and clickthrough taken from the log of  commerci web search engin have been wide us to improv the perform of these system and to better understand how user interact with them. in earli work, broder [3] examin the log of the altavista search engin and  identifi three broad categori of web queri: inform, navig and transact. rose and levinson [13]  conduct a similar studi, develop a hierarchi of queri goal with three top-level categori: inform, navig and resourc. under their taxonomi, a transact queri as defin by broder might fall under either of their three categori, depend on detail of the desir transact. lee et al. [10] us clickthrough pattern to  automat categor queri into on of two categori:  inform - for which multipl websit mai satisfi all or part of the user"s need - and navig - for which user have a particular websit in mind. under their taxonomi, a transact or resourc queri would be subsum under on of these two categori. agichtein et al. interpret caption featur, clickthrough and other user behavior as implicit feedback to learn  prefer [2] and improv rank [1] in web search. xue et al. [18] present sever method for associ queri with document by analyz clickthrough pattern and link  between document. queri associ with document in thi wai ar treat as meta-data. in effect, thei ar ad to the document content for index and rank purpos. of particular interest to us is the work of joachim et al. [9] and granka et al. [7]. thei conduct ey-track studi and analyz log data to determin the extent to which clickthrough data mai be treat as implicit relev judgment. thei identifi a trust bia, which lead user to prefer the higher rank result when all other factor ar equal. in addit, thei explor techniqu that treat click as pairwis prefer. for exampl, a click at posit n + 1 - after skip the result at posit n - mai be view as a prefer for the result at posit n+1 rel to the result at posit n. these find form the basi of the clickthrough invers methodolog we us to interpret user interact with search result. our examin of larg search log compliment their detail analysi of a smaller number of particip. 3. clickthrough invers while other research have evalu the displai of web search result through user studi - present user with a small number of differ techniqu and ask them to complet experiment task - we approach the problem by extract implicit feedback from search engin log.  examin user behavior in situ allow us to consid mani more queri and caption characterist, with the volum of avail data compens for the lack of a control lab environ. the problem remain of interpret the inform in these log as implicit indic of user prefer, and in thi matter we ar guid by the work of joachim et al. [9]. we consid caption pair, which appear adjac to on anoth in the result list. our primari tool for examin the influenc of caption featur is a type of pattern observ with respect to these caption pair, which we call a clickthrough invers. a clickthrough invers occur at posit n when the result at posit n receiv fewer click than the result at posit n + 1. follow joachim et al. [9], we interpret a  clickthrough invers as indic a prefer for the lower rank result, overcom ani trust bia. for simplic, in the remaind of thi paper we refer to the higher  rank caption in a pair as caption a and the lower rank caption as caption b. 3.1 extract clickthrough for the experi report in thi paper, we sampl a subset of the queri and clickthrough from the log of the window live search engin over a period of 3-4 dai on three separ occas: onc for result report in  section 3.3, onc for a pilot of our main experi, and onc for the experi itself (section 4 and 5). for simplic we restrict our sampl to queri submit to the us  english interfac and ignor ani queri contain complex or non-alphanumer term (e.g. oper and phrase). at the end of each sampl period, we download caption for the queri associ with the clickthrough sampl. when identifi clickthrough in search engin log, we consid onli the first clickthrough action taken by a user after enter a queri and view the result page. user ar identifi by ip address, which is a reason reliabl method of elimin multipl result from a singl user, at the cost of fals elimin result from multipl user share the same address. by focus on the initi clickthrough, we hope to  captur a user"s impress of the rel relev within a caption pair when first encount. if the user later click on other result or re-issu the same queri, we ignor these action. ani prefer captur by a clickthrough  invers is therefor a prefer among a group of user issu a particular queri, rather than a prefer on the part of a singl user. in the remaind of the paper, we us the term clickthrough to refer onli to thi initi action. given the dynam natur of the web and the volum of data involv, search engin log ar bound to contain  consider nois. for exampl, even over a period of hour or minut the order of result for a given queri can chang, with some result drop out of the top ten and new on appear. for thi reason, we retain clickthrough for a specif combin of a queri and a result onli if thi result appear in a consist posit for at least 50% of the clickthrough. clickthrough for the same result when it appear at other posit were discard. for  similar reason, if we did not detect at least ten clickthrough for a particular queri dure the sampl period, no  clickthrough for that queri were retain. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughperc posit a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughperc posit b) period tabl of element 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughperc posit c) kid onlin game figur 2: clickthrough curv for three queri: a) a stereotyp navig queri, b) a stereotyp inform queri, and c) a queri exhibit  clickthrough invers. the outcom at the end of each sampl period is a set of record, with each record describ the clickthrough for a given queri/result combin. each record includ a queri, a result posit, a titl, a snippet, a url, the  number of clickthrough for thi result, and the total number of clickthrough for thi queri. we then process thi set to gener clickthrough curv and identifi invers. 3.2 clickthrough curv it could be argu that under ideal circumst,  clickthrough invers would not be present in search engin log. a hypothet perfect search engin would respond to a queri by place the result most like to be relev first in the result list. each caption would appropri summar the content of the link page and it  relationship to the queri, allow user to make accur  judgment. later result would complement earlier on, link to novel or supplementari materi, and order by their interest to the greatest number of user. figur 2 provid clickthrough curv for three exampl queri. for each exampl, we plot the percentag of  clickthrough against posit for the top ten result. the first queri (craigslist) is stereotyp navig, show a spike at the correct answer (www.craigslist.org). the second queri is inform in the sens of lee et al. [10] (period tabl of element). it curv is flatter and less skew toward a singl result. for both queri, the number of clickthrough is consist with the result posit, with the percentag of clickthrough decreas monoton as posit increas, the ideal behavior. regrett, no search engin is perfect, and clickthrough invers ar seen for mani queri. for exampl, for the third queri (kid onlin game) the clickthrough curv  exhibit a number of clickthrough invers, with an appar prefer for the result at posit 4. sever caus mai be enlist to explain the presenc of an invers in a clickthrough curv. the search engin mai have fail in it primari goal, rank more relev result below less relev result. even when the rel rank is appropri, a caption mai fail to reflect the content of the underli page with respect to the queri, lead the user to make an incorrect judgment. befor turn to the second case, we address the first, and examin the extent to which relev alon mai explain these invers. 3.3 relev the simplest explan for the presenc of a clickthrough invers is a relev differ between the higher  rank member of caption pair and the lower rank member. in order to examin the extent to which relev plai a role in clickthrough invers, we conduct an initi  experi us a set of 1,811 queri with associ  judgment creat as part of on-go work. over a four-dai  period, we sampl the search engin log and extract over on hundr thousand click involv these queri. from these click we identifi 355 clickthrough invers,  satisfi the criteria of section 3.1, where relev judgment exist for both page. the relev judgment were made by independ  assessor view the page themselv, rather than the caption. relev wa assess on a 6-point scale. the outcom is present in figur 3, which show the explicit judgment for the 355 clickthrough invers. in all of these case, there were more click on the lower rank member of the relationship number percent rel(a) < rel(b) 119 33.5% rel(a) = rel(b) 134 37.7% rel(a) > rel(b) 102 28.7% figur 3: relev relationship at clickthrough  invers. compar relev between the higher rank member of a caption pair (rel(a)) to the  relev of the lower rank member (rel(b)), where caption a receiv fewer click than caption b. pair (b). the figur show the correspond relev  judgment. for exampl, the first row rel(a) < rel(b), indic that the higher rank member of pair (a) wa rate as less relev than the lower rank member of the pair (b). as we see in the figur, relev alon appear inadequ to explain the major of clickthrough invers. for  twothird of the invers (236), the page associ with  caption a is at least as relev as the page associ with  caption b. for 28.7% of the invers, a ha greater relev than b, which receiv the greater number of clickthrough. 4. influenc of caption featur have demonstr that clickthrough invers cannot alwai be explain by relev differ, we explor what featur of caption pair, if ani, lead user to prefer on caption over anoth. for exampl, we mai  hypothes that the absenc of a snippet in caption a and the presenc of a snippet in caption b (e.g. caption 2 and 3 in figur 1) lead user to prefer caption a. nonetheless, due to compet factor, a larg set of clickthrough  invers mai also includ pair where the snippet is miss in caption b and not in caption a. howev, if we compar a larg set of clickthrough invers to a similar set of pair for which the clickthrough ar consist with their  rank, we would expect to see rel more pair where the snippet wa miss in caption a. 4.1 evalu methodolog follow thi line of reason, we extract two set of caption pair from search log over a three dai period. the first is a set of nearli five thousand clickthrough  invers, extract accord to the procedur describ in section 3.1. the second is a correspond set of caption pair that do not exhibit clickthrough invers. in other word, for pair in thi set, the result at the higher rank (caption a) receiv more clickthrough than the result at the lower rank (caption b). to the greatest extent possibl, each pair in the second set wa select to correspond to a pair in the first set, in term of result posit and number of click on each result. we refer to the first set, contain clickthrough invers, as the inv set; we refer to the  second set, contain caption pair for which the clickthrough ar consist with their rank order, as the con set. we extract a number of featur character snippet (describ in detail in the next section) and compar the presenc of each featur in the inv and con set. we describ the featur as a hypothes prefer (e.g., a prefer for caption contain a snippet). thu, in  either set, a given featur mai be present in on of two form: favor the higher rank caption (caption a) or favor the lower rank caption (caption b). for exampl, the

the higher rank result. these featur ar express from the perspect of the preval relationship predict for clickthrough invers. senc of a snippet in caption a favor caption b, and the absenc of a snippet in caption b favor caption a. when the featur favor caption b (consist with a clickthrough invers) we refer to the caption pair as a posit pair. when the featur favor caption a, we refer to it as a  neg pair. for miss snippet, a posit pair ha the caption miss in caption a (but not b) and a neg pair ha the caption miss in b (but not a). thu, for a specif featur, we can construct four subset: 1) inv+, the set of posit pair from inv; 2) inv−, the set of neg pair from inv; 3) con+; the set of posit pair from con; and 4) con− the set of neg pair from con. the set inv+, inv−, con+, and con− will contain differ subset of inv and con for each featur. when state a featur correspond to a hypothes user prefer, we follow the practic of state the featur with the expect that the size of inv+ rel to the size of inv− should be greater than the size of con+ rel to the size of con−. for exampl, we state the miss snippet featur as snippet miss in caption a and present in caption b. thi evalu methodolog allow us to construct a  conting tabl for each featur, with inv essenti form the experiment group and con the control group. we can then appli pearson"s chi-squar test for signific. 4.2 featur figur 4 list the featur test. mani of the featur on thi list correspond to our own assumpt regard the import of certain caption characterist: the presenc of queri term, the inclus of a snippet, and the  import of queri term match in the titl. other featur suggest themselv dure the examin of the snippet collect as part of the studi describ in section 3.3 and dure a pilot of the evalu methodolog (section 4.1). for thi pilot we collect inv and con set of similar size, and us these set to evalu a preliminari list of featur and to establish appropri paramet for the  snippetshort and readabl featur. in the pilot, all of the featur list in figur 4 were signific at the 95% level. a small number of other featur were drop after the pilot. these featur all captur simpl aspect of the caption. the first featur concern the exist of a snippet and the second concern the rel size of snippet. apart from thi first featur, we ignor pair where on caption ha a miss snippet. these pair ar not includ in the set construct for the remain featur, sinc caption with miss snippet do not contain all the element of a  standard caption and we want to avoid their influenc. the next six featur concern the locat and number of match queri term. for the first five, a match for each queri term is count onli onc, addit match for the same term ar ignor. the matchal featur test the idea that match all the queri term exactli onc is prefer to match a subset of the term mani time with a least on queri term unmatch. the next three featur concern the url, captur  aspect of their length and complex, and the last four  featur concern caption content. the first two of these content featur (offici and home) suggest claim about the  import or signific of the associ page. the third content featur (imag) suggest the presenc of an imag galleri, a popular genr of web page. term repres by thi featur includ pictur, pic, and galleri. the last content featur (readabl) appli an ad-hoc readabl metric to each snippet. regular user of web search engin mai notic occasion snippet that consist of littl more than list of word and phrase, rather than a coher descript. we defin our own metric, sinc the flesch-kincaid readabl score and similar measur ar  intend for entir document not text fragment. while the metric ha not been experiment valid, it doe reflect our intuit and observ regard result snippet. in english, the 100 most frequent word repres about 48% of text, and we would expect readabl prose, as oppos to a disjoint list of word, to contain these word in roughli thi proport. the readabl featur comput the  percentag of these top-100 word appear in each caption. if these word repres more than 40% of on caption and less than 10% of the other, the pair is includ in the  appropri set. featur tag inv+ inv− %+ con+ con− %+ χ2 p-valu missingsnippet 185 121 60.4 144 133 51.9 4.2443 0.0393 snippetshort 20 6 76.9 12 16 42.8 6.4803 0.0109 termmatchtitl 800 559 58.8 660 700 48.5

claim that miss snippet, short snippet, miss queri term and complex url neg impact clickthrough. while thi outcom mai not be  surpris, we ar awar of no other work that can provid  support for claim of thi type in the context of a commerci web search engin. thi work wa origin motiv by our desir to  valid some simpl guidelin for the gener of  captionssummar opinion that we formul while work on relat issu. while our result do not direct address all of the mani variabl that influenc user understand of caption, thei ar consist with the major guidelin. further work is need to provid addit support for the guidelin and to understand the relationship among variabl. the first of these guidelin underscor the import of displai queri term in context: whenev possibl all of the queri term should appear in the caption, reflect their relationship to the associ page. if a queri term is  miss from a caption, the user mai have no idea why the result wa return. the result for the matchal featur directli support thi guidelin. the result for termmatchtitl and termmatchtsu confirm that match more term is  desir. other featur provid addit indirect support for thi guidelin, and none of the result ar inconsist with it. a second guidelin speak to the desir of  present the user with a readabl snippet: when queri term ar present in the titl, thei need not be repeat in the  snippet. in particular, when a high-qualiti queri-independ summari is avail from an extern sourc, such as a web directori, it mai be more appropri to displai thi summari than a lower-qualiti queri-depend fragment  select on-the-fly. when titl ar avail from multipl sourc -the header, the bodi, web directori - a caption gener algorithm might a select a combin of titl, snippet and url that includ as mani of the queri term as possibl. when a titl contain all queri term can be found, the algorithm might select a queri-independ  snippet. the matchal and readabl featur directli support thi guidelin. onc again, other featur provid indirect support, and none of the result ar inconsist with it. final, the length and complex of a url influenc user behavior. when queri term appear in the url thei should highlight or otherwis distinguish. when  multipl url refer the same page (due to re-direct, etc.) the shortest url should be prefer, provid that all queri term will still appear in the caption. in other word, url should be select and displai in a manner that emphas their relationship to the queri. the three url featur, as well as termmatchtsu, directli support thi guidelin. the influenc of the offici and imag featur led us to wonder what other term ar preval in the caption of clickthrough invers. as an addit experi, we treat each of the term appear in the inv and con set as a separ featur (case normal), rank them by their χ2 valu. the result ar present in figur 6. sinc we us the χ2 statist as a diverg measur, rather than a signific test, no p-valu ar given. the final column of the tabl indic the direct of the influenc, whether the presenc of the term posit or neg influenc clickthrough. the posit influenc of offici ha alreadi been  observ (the differ in the χ2 valu from that of figur 5 is due to stem). none of the term includ in the imag rank term χ2 influenc 1 encyclopedia 114.6891 ↓ 2 wikipedia 94.0033 ↓ 3 offici 36.5566 ↑ 4 and 28.3349 ↑ 5 tourism 25.2003 ↑ 6 attract 24.7283 ↑ 7 free 23.6529 ↓ 8 sexi 21.9773 ↑ 9 medlineplu 19.9726 ↓ 10 inform 19.9115 ↑ figur 6: word exhibit the greatest posit (↑) and neg (↓) influenc on clickthrough pattern. featur appear in the top ten, but pictur and photo appear at posit 21 and 22. the high rank given to and mai be relat to readabl (the term the appear in  posit 20). most surpris to us is the neg influenc of the term: encyclopedia, wikipedia, free, and medlineplu. the first three term appear in the titl of wikipedia articl3 and the last appear in the titl of medlineplu articl4 . these individu word-level featur provid hint about  issu. more detail analys and further experi will be requir to understand these featur. 6. conclus clickthrough invers form an appropri tool for  assess the influenc of caption featur. us clickthrough invers, we have demonstr that rel simpl  caption featur can significantli influenc user behavior. to our knowledg, thi is first methodolog valid for  assess the qualiti of web caption through implicit  feedback. in the futur, we hope to substanti expand thi work, consid more featur over larger dataset. we also hope to directli address the goal of predict relev from clickthough and other inform present in search engin log. 7. acknowledg thi work wa conduct while the first author wa  visit microsoft research. the author thank member of the window live team for their comment and assist,
