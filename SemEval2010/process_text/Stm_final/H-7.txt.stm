[inform search and retriev]: inform  filter gener term: algorithm 1. introduct person is the futur of the web, and it ha achiev great success in industri applic. for exampl, onlin store, such as amazon and netflix, provid custom  recommend for addit product or servic base on a user"s histori. recent offer such as my msn, my yahoo!, my googl, and googl new have attract much attent due to their potenti abil to infer a user"s interest from hi/her histori. on major person topic studi in the  inform retriev commun is content-base person  recommend system1 . these system learn user-specif  profil from user feedback so that thei can recommend  inform tailor to each individu user"s interest without requir the user to make an explicit queri. learn the user profil is the core problem for these system. a user profil is usual a classifi that can identifi whether a document is relev to the user or not, or a regress model that tell how relev a document is to the user. on major challeng of build a recommend or  person system is that the profil learn for a particular user is usual of low qualiti when the amount of data from that particular user is small. thi is known as the cold start problem. thi mean that ani new user must endur poor initi perform until suffici feedback from that user is provid to learn a reliabl user profil. there ha been much research on improv  classif accuraci when the amount of label train data is small. the semi-supervis learn approach combin  unlabel and label data togeth to achiev thi goal [26]. anoth approach is us domain knowledg. research have modifi differ learn algorithm, such as  na¨ıvebay [17], logist regress [7], and svm [22], to integr domain knowledg into a text classifi. the third approach is borrow train data from other resourc [5][7]. the effect of these differ approach is mix, due to how well the underli model assumpt fit the data. on well-receiv approach to improv recommend system perform for a particular user is borrow  inform from other user through a bayesian hierarch model approach. sever research have demonstr that thi approach effect trade off between share and user-specif inform, thu allevi poor initi  perform for each user[27][25]. in order to learn a bayesian hierarch model, the  system usual tri to find the most like model paramet for the given data. a matur recommend system  usual work for million of user. it is well known that  learn the optim paramet of a bayesian hierarch model is computation expens when there ar thousand or million of user. the em algorithm is a commonli us techniqu for paramet learn due to it simplic and converg guarante. howev, a content base  recommend system often handl document in a veri high dimension space, in which each document is repres by a veri spars vector. with care analysi of the em algorithm in thi scenario (section 4), we find that the em tere, or item-base collabor filter. in thi paper, the word filter and recommend ar us  interchang. algorithm converg veri slowli due to the spars of the input variabl. we also find that updat the model paramet at each em iter is also expens with  comput complex of o(mk), where m is the number of user and k is the number of dimens. thi paper modifi the standard em algorithm to creat an improv learn algorithm, which we call the modifi em algorithm. the basic idea is that instead of  calcul the numer solut for all the user profil paramet, we deriv the analyt solut of the paramet for some featur dimens, and at the m step us the analyt  solut instead of the numer solut estim at e step for those paramet. thi greatli reduc the comput at a singl em iter, and also ha the benefit of  increas the converg speed of the learn algorithm. the propos techniqu is not onli well support by theori, but also by experiment result. the organ of the remain part of thi paper is as follow: section 3 describ the bayesian hierarch linear regress model framework us for content-base  recommend. section 4 describ how to learn the model paramet us the standard em algorithm, along with us the new techniqu propos in thi paper. the  experiment set and result us to valid the propos learn techniqu ar report in section 5 and 6.  section 7 summar and offer conclud remark. 2. relat work provid person recommend to user ha been identifi as a veri import problem in the ir commun sinc the 1970"s. the approach that have been us to solv thi problem can be roughli classifi into two major categori: content base filter versu collabor  filter. content-base filter studi the scenario where a recommend system monitor a document stream and push document that match a user profil to the  correspond user. the user mai read the deliv document and provid explicit relev feedback, which the filter system then us to updat the user"s profil us relev feedback retriev model (e.g. boolean model, vector space model, tradit probabilist model [20] , infer  network [3] and languag model [6]) or machin learn  algorithm (e.g. support vector machin (svm), k nearest neighbor (k-nn) cluster, neural network, logist  regress, or winnow [16] [4] [23]). collabor filter goe beyond mere us document content to recommend item to a user by leverag inform from other user with similar tast and prefer in the past.  memorybas heurist and model base approach have been us in collabor filter task [15] [8] [2] [14] [12] [11]. thi paper contribut to the content-base  recommend research by improv the effici and effect of bayesian hierarch linear model, which have a strong theoret basi and good empir perform on  recommend task[27][25]. thi paper doe not intend to compar content-base filter with collabor filter or claim which on is a better. we think each complement the other, and that content-base filter is extrem  us for handl new document/item with littl or no user feedback. similar to some other research[18][1][21], we found that a recommend system will be more effect when both techniqu ar combin. howev, thi is  beyond the scope of thi paper and thu not discuss here. 3. bayesian hierarch linear regress assum there ar m user in the system. the task of the system is to recommend document that ar relev to each user. for each user, the system learn a user model from the user"s histori. in the rest of thi paper, we will us the follow notat to repres the variabl in the system. m = 1, 2, ..., m: the index for each individu user. m is the total number of user. wm: the user model paramet associ with user m. wm is a k dimension vector. j = 1, 2, ..., jm: the index for a set of data for user m. jm is the number of train data for user m. dm = {(xm,j, ym,j)}: a set of data associ with user m. xm,j is a k dimension vector that repres the mth user"s jth train document.2 ym,j is a scalar that repres the label of document xm,j. k = 1, 2, ..., k: the dimension index of input variabl x. the bayesian hierarch model approach ha been wide us in real-world inform retriev applic. gener bayesian hierarch linear model, on of the simplest bayesian hierarch model, ar commonli us and have achiev good perform on collabor  filter [25] and content-base adapt filter [27] task. figur 1 show the graphic represent of a bayesian hierarch model. in thi graph, each user model is  repres by a random vector wm. we assum a user model is sampl randomli from a prior distribut p(w|Φ). the system can predict the user label y of a document x given an estim of wm (or wm"s distribut) us a function y = f(x, w). the model is call gener bayesian  hierarch linear model when y = f(wt x) is ani gener linear model such as logist regress, svm, and linear regress. to reliabl estim the user model wm, the  system can borrow inform from other user through the prior Φ = (µ, Σ). now we look at on commonli us model where y = wt x + , where ∼ n(0, σ2 ) is a random nois [25][27]. assum that each user model wm is an independ draw from a popul distribut p(w|Φ), which is govern by some unknown hyperparamet Φ. let the prior distribut of user model w be a gaussian distribut with paramet Φ = (µ, Σ), which is the commonli us prior for linear model. µ = (µ1, µ2, ..., µk ) is a k dimension vector that repres the mean of the gaussian distribut, and Σ is the covari matrix of the gaussian. usual, a normal distribut n(0, ai) and an invers wishart distribut p(Σ) ∝ |Σ|− 1 2 b exp(−1 2 ctr(Σ−1 )) ar us as hyperprior to model the prior distribut of µ and Σ respect. i is the k dimension ident matrix, and a, b, and c ar real number. with these set, we have the follow model for the system: 1. µ and Σ ar sampl from n(0, ai) and iwν (ai),  respect. 2 the first dimens of x is a dummi variabl that alwai equal to 1. figur 1: illustr of depend of variabl in the hierarch model. the rate, y, for a  document, x, is condit on the document and the user model, wm, associ with the user m. user share inform about their model through the prior, Φ = (µ, Σ). 2. for each user m, wm is sampl randomli from a  normal distribut: wm ∼ n(µ, Σ2 ) 3. for each item xm,j, ym,j is sampl randomli from a normal distribut: ym,j ∼ n(wt mxm,j, σ2 ). let θ = (Φ, w1, w2, ..., wm ) repres the paramet of thi system that need to be estim. the joint  likelihood for all the variabl in the probabilist model, which includ the data and the paramet, is: p(d, θ) = p(Φ) m p(wm|Φ) j p(ym,j|xm,j, wm) (1) for simplic, we assum a, b, c, and σ ar provid to the system. 4. model paramet learn if the prior Φ is known, find the optim wm is  straightforward: it is a simpl linear regress. therefor, we will focu on estim Φ. the maximum a priori solut of Φ is given by Φmap = arg max Φ p(Φ|d) (2) = arg max Φ p(Φ, d) p(d) (3) = arg max Φ p(d|Φ)p(Φ) (4) = arg max Φ w p(d|w, Φ)p(w|Φ)p(Φ)dw (5) find the optim solut for the abov problem is  challeng, sinc we need to integr over all w = (w1, w2, ..., wm ), which ar unobserv hidden variabl. 4.1 em algorithm for bayesian hierarch linear model in equat 5, Φ is the paramet need to be estim, and the result depend on unobserv latent variabl w. thi kind of optim problem is usual solv by the em algorithm. appli em to the abov problem, the set of user model w ar the unobserv hidden variabl and we have: q = w p(w|µ, Σ2 , dm) log p(µ, Σ2 , w, d)dw base on the deriv of the em formula present in [24], we have the follow expect-maxim step for find the optim hyperparamet. for space  consider, we omit the deriv in thi paper sinc it is not the focu of our work. e step: for each user m, estim the user model  distribut p(wm|dm, Φ) = n(wm; ¯wm, Σ2 m) base on the current estim of the prior Φ = (µ, Σ2 ). ¯wm = ((Σ2 )−1 + sxx,m σ2 )−1 ( sxy,m σ2 + (Σ2 )−1 µ) (6) Σ2 m = ((Σ2 )−1 + sxx,m σ2 )−1 (7) where sxx,m = j xm,jxt m,j sxy,m = j xm,jym,j m step: optim the prior Φ = (µ, Σ2 ) base on the  estim from the last e step. µ = 1 m m ¯wm (8) Σ2 = 1 m m Σ2 m + ( ¯wm − µ)( ¯wm − µ)t (9) mani machin learn driven ir system us a point  estim of the paramet at differ stage in the system. howev, we ar estim the posterior distribut of the variabl at the e step. thi avoid overfit wm to a particular user"s data, which mai be small and noisi. a detail discuss about thi subject appear in [10]. 4.2 new algorithm: modifi em although the em algorithm is wide studi and us in machin learn applic, us the abov em process to solv bayesian hierarch linear model in larg-scale  inform retriev system is still too computation  expens. in thi section, we describ why the learn rate of the em algorithm is slow in our applic and introduc a new techniqu to make the learn of the bayesian  hierarch linear model scalabl. the deriv of the new learn algorithm will be base on the em algorithm  describ in the previou section. first, the covari matric Σ2 , Σ2 m ar usual too larg to be computation feasibl. for simplic, and as a  common practic in ir, we do not model the correl between featur. thu we approxim these matric with k  dimension diagon matric. in the rest of the paper, we us these symbol to repres their diagon approxim: Σ2 =     σ2 1 0 .. 0 0 σ2 2 .. 0 .. .. .. .. 0 0 .. σ2 k     Σ2 m =     σ2 m,1 0 .. 0 0 σ2 m,2 .. 0 .. .. .. .. 0 0 .. σ2 m,k     secondli, and most importantli, the input space is veri spars and there ar mani dimens that ar not relat to a particular user in a real ir applic. for exampl, let us consid a movi recommend system, with the input variabl x repres a particular movi. for the jth movi that the user m ha seen, let xm,j,k = 1 if the director of the movi is jean-pierr jeunet (index by k). here we assum that whether or not that thi director direct a specif movi is repres by the kth dimens. if the user m ha never seen a movi direct by jean-pierr jeunet, then the correspond dimens is alwai zero (xm,j,k = 0 for all j) . on major drawback of the em algorithm is that the  import of a featur, µk, mai be greatli domin by user who have never encount thi featur (i.e. j xm,j,k = 0) at the m step (equat 8). assum that 100 out of 1  million user have view the movi direct by jean-pierr jeunet, and that the viewer have rate all of hi movi as excel. intuit, he is a good director and the weight for him (µk) should be high. befor the em iter, the initi valu of µ is usual set to 0. sinc the other 999,900 user have not seen thi movi, their correspond weight (w1,k, w2,k, ..., wm,k..., w999900,k) for that director would be veri small initi. thu the correspond weight of the director in the prior µk at the first m step would be veri low , and the varianc σm,k will be larg (equat 8 and 7). it is undesir that user who have never seen ani movi produc by the director influenc the import of the director so much. thi make the converg of the standard em algorithm veri slow. now let"s look at whether we can improv the learn speed of the algorithm. without a loss of gener, let us assum that the kth dimens of the input variabl x is not relat to a particular user m. by which we mean, xm,j,k = 0 for all j = 1, ..., jm. it is straightforward to prove that the kth row and kth column of sxx,m ar complet fill with zero, and that the kth dimens of sxy,m is zero as well. thu the correspond kth dimens of the user model"s mean, ¯wm, should be equal to that of the prior: ¯wm,k = µk, with the correspond covari of σm,k = σk. at the m step, the standard em algorithm us the  numer solut of the distribut p(wm|dm, Φ) estim at e step (equat 8 and equat 7). howev, the  numer solut ar veri unreli for ¯wm,k and σm,k when the kth dimens is not relat to the mth user. a better approach is us the analyt solut ¯wm,k = µk, and σm,k = σk for the unrel (m, k) pair, along with the numer solut estim at e step for the other (m, k) pair. thu we get the follow new em-like algorithm: modifi e step: for each user m, estim the user model distribut p(wm|dm, Φ) = n(wm; ¯wm, Σ2 m) base on the current estim of σ , µ, Σ2 . ¯wm = ((Σ2 )−1 + sxx,m σ2 )−1 ( sxy,m σ2 + (Σ2 )−1 µ)(10) σ2 m,k = ((σ2 k)−1 + sxx,m,k σ2 )−1 (11) where sxx,m,k = j x2 m,j,k and sxy,m,k = j xm,j,kym,j modifi m step optim the prior Φ = (µ, Σ2 ) base on the estim from the last e step for relat  userfeatur pair. the m step implicitli us the analyt solut for unrel user-featur pair. µk = 1 mk m:relat ¯wm,k (12) σ2 k = 1 mk m:relat σ2 m,k +( ¯wm,k − µk)( ¯wm,k − µk)t (13) where mk is the number of user that ar relat to featur k we onli estim the diagon of Σ2 m and Σ sinc we ar us the diagon approxim of the covari  matric. to estim ¯wm, we onli need to calcul the  numer solut for dimens that ar relat to user m. to estim σ2 k and µk, we onli sum over user that ar relat to the kth featur. there ar two major benefit of the new algorithm. first, becaus onli the relat (m, k) pair ar need at the  modifi m step, the comput complex in a singl em iter is much smaller when the data is spars, and mani of (m, k) pair ar unrel. second, the paramet  estim at the modifi m step (equat 12 - 13) ar more accur than the standard m step describ in  section 4.1 becaus the exact analyt solut ¯wm,k = µk and σm,k = σk for the unrel (m, k) pair were us in the new algorithm instead of an approxim solut as in the standard algorithm. 5. experiment methodolog 5.1 evalu data set to evalu the propos techniqu, we us the follow three major data set (tabl 1): movielen data: thi data set wa creat by combin the relev judgment from the movielen[9] data set with document from the internet movi databas (imdb). movielen allow user to rank how much he/she enjoi a specif movi on a scale from 1 to 5. thi likeabl rate wa us as a  measur of how relev the document repres the correspond movi is to the user. we consid document with likeabl score of 4 or 5 as  relev, and document with a score of 1 to 3 as  irrelev to the user. movielen provid relev judgment on 3,057 document from 6,040 separ user. on averag, each user rate 151 movi, of these 87 were judg to be relev. the averag score for a document wa 3.58. document  repres each movi were construct from the portion of the imdb databas that is avail for public  download[13]. base on thi databas, we creat on  document per movi that contain the relev  inform about it (e.g. director, actor, etc.). tabl 1: data set statist. on reuter, the  number of rate for a simul user is the number of document relev to the correspond topic. data user doc rate per user movielen 6,040 3,057 151 netflix-all 480,189 17,770 208 netflix-1000 1000 17,770

set of actual movi rental custom relev  judgment from netflix[19]. netflix publicli provid the relev judgment of 480,189 anonym custom. there ar around 100 million rate on a scale of 1 to 5 for 17,770 document. similar to movielen, we consid document with likeabl score of 4 or 5 as relev. thi number wa reduc to 1000 custom through random sampl. the averag custom on the  reduc data set provid 127 judgment, with 70 be deem relev. the averag score for document is 3.55. reuter data: thi is the reuter corpu, volum 1. it cover 810,000 reuter english languag new stori from august 20, 1996 to august 19, 1997. onli the first 100,000 new were us in our experi. the reuter corpu come with a topic hierarchi. each document is assign to on of sever locat on the hierarch tree. the first level of the tree  contain four topic, denot as c, e, m, and g. for the experi in thi paper, the tree wa cut at level 1 to creat four smaller tree, each of which correspond to on smaller data set: reuter-e reuter-c,  reutersm and reuter-g. for each small data set, we creat sever profil, on profil for each node in a sub-tree, to simul multipl user, each with a relat, yet separ definit of relev. all the user profil on a sub-tree ar suppos to share the same prior model distribut. sinc thi corpu explicitli  indic onli the relev document for a topic(user), all other document ar consid irrelev. 5.2 evalu we design the experi to answer the follow three question: 1. do we need to take the effort to us a bayesian  approach and learn a prior from other user? 2. doe the new algorithm work better than the standard em algorithm for learn the bayesian hierarch linear model? 3. can the new algorithm quickli learn mani user  model? to answer the first question, we compar the bayesian  hierarch model with commonli us norm-2 regular linear regress model. in fact, the commonli us  approach is equival to the model learn at the end of the first em iter. to answer the second question, we  compar the propos new algorithm with the standard em algorithm to see whether the new learn algorithm is  better. to answer the third question, we test the effici of the new algorithm on the entir netflix data set where about half a million user model need to be learn togeth. for the movielen and netflix data set, algorithm  effect wa measur by mean squar error, while on the reuter data set classif error wa us becaus it wa more inform. we first evalu the perform on each individu user, and then estim the macro averag over all user. statist test (t-test) were carri out to see whether the result ar signific. for the experi on the movielen and netflix data set, we us a random sampl of 90% of each user for  train, and the rest for test. on reuter" data set, becaus there ar too mani relev document for each topic in the corpu, we us a random sampl of 10% of each topic for train, and 10% of the remain document for test. for all run, we set (a, b, c, Σ ) = (0.1, 10, 0.1, 1) manual. 6. experiment result figur 2, figur 3, and figur 4 show that on all data set, the bayesian hierarch model approach ha a  statist signific improv over the regular linear regress model, which is equival to the bayesian  hierarch model learn at the first iter. further analysi show a neg correl between the number of train data for a user and the improv the system get. thi suggest that the borrow inform from other user ha more signific improv for user with less  train data, which is as expect. howev, the strength of the correl differ over data set, and the amount of  train data is not the onli characterist that will influenc the final perform. figur 2 and figur 3 show that the propos new  algorithm work better than the standard em algorithm on the netflix and movielen data set. thi is not  surpris sinc the number of relat featur-user pair is much smaller than the number of unrel featur-user pair on these two data set, and thu the propos new algorithm is expect to work better. figur 4 show that the two algorithm work similarli on the reuter-e data set. the accuraci of the new  algorithm is similar to that of the standard em algorithm at each iter. the gener pattern ar veri similar on other reuter" subset. further analysi show that onli 58% of the user-featur pair ar unrel on thi data set. sinc the number of unrel user-featur pair is not  extrem larg, the spars is not a seriou problem on the reuter data set. thu the two learn algorithm  perform similarli. the result suggest that onli on a corpu where the number of unrel user-featur pair is much larger than the number of relat pair, such as on the  netflix data set, the propos techniqu will get a signific improv over standard em. howev, the experi also show that when the assumpt doe not hold, the new algorithm doe not hurt perform. although the propos techniqu is faster than standard figur 2: perform on a netflix subset with 1,000 user. the new algorithm is statist significantli better than em algorithm at iter 2 - 10. norm-2 regular linear model ar equival to the bayesian hierarch model learn at the first iter, and ar statist significantli wors than the bayesian hierarch model. 0 2 4 6 8 10 1 1.05 1.1 1.15 1.2 1.25 1.3

in a reliabl estim. we evalu the algorithm on the whole netflix data set (480,189 user, 159,836 featur, and 100 million rate) run on a singl cpu pc (2gb  memori, p4 3ghz). the system finish on modifi em  iter in about 4 hour. thi demonstr that the propos techniqu can effici handl larg-scale system like  netflix. 7. conclus content-base user profil learn is an import  problem and is the kei to provid person recommend to a user, especi for recommend new item with a small number of rate. the bayesian hierarch  model approach is becom an import user profil learn approach due to it theoret justifi abil to help on user through inform transfer from the other user by wai of hyperprior. thi paper examin the weak of the popular em base learn approach for bayesian hierarch linear  model and propos a better learn techniqu call modifi em. we show that the new techniqu is theoret more computation effici than the standard em algorithm. evalu on the movielen and netflix data set  demonstr the effect of the new techniqu when the data is spars, by which we mean the ratio of relat user-featur pair to unrel pair is small. evalu on the reuter data set show that the new techniqu perform similar to the standard em algorithm when the spars condit doe not hold. in gener, it is better to us the new  algorithm sinc it is as simpl as standard em, the perform is either better or similar to em, and the comput  complex is lower at each iter. it is worth mention that even if the origin problem space is not spars, spars can be creat artifici when a recommend system us user-specif featur select techniqu to reduc the nois and user model complex. the propos techniqu can also be adapt to improv the learn in such a  scenario. we also demonstr that the propos techniqu can learn half a million user profil from 100 million rate in a few hour with a singl cpu. the research is import becaus scalabl is a major concern for research when us the bayesian hierarch linear model approach to build a practic larg scale system, even though the literatur have demonstr the effect of the model in mani applic. our work is on major step on the road to make bayesian hierarch linear model more practic. the propos new techniqu can be easili adapt to run on a cluster of machin, and thu further speed up the learn process to handl a larger scale system with hundr of million of user. the research ha much potenti to benefit peopl us em algorithm on mani other ir problem as well as  machin learn problem. em algorithm is a commonli us machin learn techniqu. it is us to find model  paramet in mani ir problem where the train data is veri spars. although we ar focus on the bayesian  hierarch linear model for recommend and filter, the new idea of us analyt solut instead of numer solut for unrel user-featur pair at the m step could be adapt to mani other problem. 8. acknowledg we thank wei xu, david lewi and anonym  review for valuabl feedback on the work describ in thi  paper. part of the
