(e.g. you begin us a particular im system - or social-network site, or electron document format - if enough of your friend ar user of it.) as thi unfold, there can be a cascad sequenc of node switch to a, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reach in the limit: thi equilibrium mai involv uniform, with all node adopt a; or it mai involv coexist, with the node partit into a set adopt a and a set adopt b, and edg yield zero payoff connect the two set. morri [13] provid a set of eleg graph-theoret character for when these qualit differ type of equilibria aris, in term of the  underli network topolog and the qualiti of a rel to b (i.e. the rel size of 1 − q and q). compat, interoper, and bilingu. in most of the set that form the motiv for diffus model, coexist (howev unbalanc) is the typic outcom: for exampl, human languag and social convent coexist along geograph  boundari; it is a stabl outcom for the financi industri to us  window while the entertain industri us mac os. an import piec that is arguabl miss from the basic game-theoret  model of diffus, howev, is a more detail pictur of what is  happen at the coexist boundari, where the basic form of the model posit node that adopt a link to node that adopt b. in these motiv set for the model, of cours, on veri often see interfac region in which individu essenti becom bilingu. in the case of human languag diffus, thi  bilingu is meant liter: geograph region where there is substanti interact with speaker of two differ languag tend to have inhabit who speak both. but bilingu is also an essenti featur of technolog interact: in the end, mani peopl have account on multipl im system, for exampl, and more  gener mani maintain the abil to work within multipl comput system so as to collabor with peopl embed in each. take thi view, it is natur to ask how diffus model  behav when extend so that certain node can be bilingu in thi veri gener sens, adopt both strategi at some cost to  themselv. what might we learn from such an extens? to begin with, it ha the potenti to provid a valuabl perspect on the question of compat and incompat that underpin  competit among technolog compani. there is a larg literatur on how compat among technolog affect competit  between firm, and in particular how incompat mai be a  benefici strateg decis for certain particip in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12]. whinston [18] provid an interest taxonomi of differ kind of strateg incompat; and specif industri case studi (includ theoret perspect) have recent been carri out for commerci bank [10], copi and imag technolog [11] and instant messeng system [6]. while these exist model of compat captur network effect in the sens that the user in the market prefer to us  technolog that is more widespread, thei do not captur the more  finegrain network phenomenon repres by diffus - that each user is includ it local view in the decis, base on what it own social network neighbor ar do. a diffus model that  incorpor such extens could provid insight into the structur of boundari in the network between technolog; it could  potenti offer a graph-theoret basi for how incompat mai benefit an exist technolog, by strengthen these boundari and prevent the incurs of a new, better technolog. the present work: diffus with bilingu behavior. in thi paper, we develop a set of diffus model that incorpor notion of compat and bilingu, and we find that some unexpect phenomena emerg even from veri simpl version of the model. we begin with perhap the simplest wai of extend morri"s model discuss abov to incorpor bilingu behavior. consid again the exampl of im system a and b, with the payoff  structur as befor, but now suppos that each node can adopt a third strategi, denot ab, in which it decid to us both a and b. an adopt of ab get to us, on an edg-by-edg basi, whichev of a or b yield higher payoff in each interact, and the payoff structur is defin accord to thi principl: if an adopt of ab interact with an adopt of b, both receiv q; with an adopt of a, both receiv 1 − q; and with anoth adopt of ab, both  receiv max(q, 1 − q). final, an adopt of ab pai a fix-cost penalti of c (i.e. −c is ad to it total payoff) to repres the cost of have to maintain both technolog. thu, in thi model, there ar two paramet that can be vari: the rel qualiti of the two technolog (encod by q), and the cost of be bilingu, which reflect a type of incompat (encod by c). follow [13] we assum the underli graph g is infinit; we further assum that for some natur number Δ, each node ha degre Δ.1 we ar interest in the question pose at the outset, of whether a new technolog a can spread through a network where almost everyon is initi us b. formal, we sai that strategi a can becom epidem if the follow hold: start from a state in which all node in a finit set s adopt a, and all other node adopt b, a sequenc of best-respons updat (potenti with  tiebreak) in g − s caus everi node to eventu adopt a. we also introduc on addit bit of notat that will be us in the subsequ section: we defin r = c/Δ, the fix penalti for adopt ab, scale so that it is a per-edg cost. in the morri model, where the onli strateg option ar a and b, a kei paramet is the contagion threshold of g, denot q∗ (g): thi is the supremum of q for which a can becom epidem in g with paramet q in the payoff structur. a central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possibl contagion threshold for ani graph: supg q∗ (g) = 1 2 . inde, there exist graph in which the contagion threshold is as larg as 1 2 (includ the infinit line - the uniqu infinit connect 2-regular graph); on the other hand, on can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 . in our model where the bilingu strategi ab is possibl, we have a two-dimension paramet space, so instead of a  contagion threshold q∗ (g) we have an epidem region Ω(g), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which a can becom epidem in g. and in place of the maximum possibl contagion  threshold supg q∗ (g), we must consid the gener epidem region Ω = ∪gΩ(g), where the union is taken over all infinit Δ-regular graph; thi is the set of all (q, r) valu for which a can becom epidem in some Δ-regular network. 1 we can obtain strictli analog result by take a sequenc of finit graph and express result asymptot, but the us of an infinit bound-degre graph g make it conceptu much cleaner to express the result (as it doe in morri"s paper [13]): less intric quantif is need to express the diffus properti, and the qualit phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 figur 1: the region of the (q, r) plane for which technolog a can becom epidem on the infinit line. our result. we find, first of all, that the epidem region Ω(g) can be unexpectedli complex, even for veri simpl graph g.  figur 1 show the epidem region for the infinit line; on observ that neither the region Ω(g) nor it complement is convex in the posit quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (we find analog shape that becom even more complex for other  simpl infinit graph structur; see for exampl figur 3 and 4.) in particular, thi mean that for valu of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategi a can becom epidem on the infinit line if r is  suffici small or suffici larg, but not if r take valu in some intermedi interv. in other word, strategi b (which repres the wors technolog, sinc q < 1 2 ) will surviv if and onli if the cost of be bilingu is calibr to lie in thi middl interv. thi is a reflect of limit compat - that it mai be in the interest of an incumb technolog to make it difficult but not too difficult to us a new technolog - and we find it surpris that it should emerg from a basic model on such a simpl network structur. it is natur to ask whether there is a qualit  interpret of how thi aris from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpret, as follow. when r is veri small, it is cheap for node to adopt ab as a strategi, and so ab spread through the whole network. onc ab is everywher, the best-respons updat caus all node to switch to a, sinc thei get the same interact  benefit without pai the penalti of r. when r is veri larg, node at the interfac, with on a  neighbor and on b neighbor, will find it too expens to choos ab, so thei will choos a (the better technolog), and henc a will spread step-by-step through the network. when r take an intermedi valu, a node v at the  interfac, with on a neighbor and on b neighbor, will find it most benefici to adopt ab as a strategi. onc thi happen, the neighbor of v who is plai b will not have suffici incent to switch, and the best-respons updat make no further progress. henc, thi intermedi valu of r allow a boundari of ab to form between the adopt of a and the adopt of b. in short, the situat face b is thi: if it is too permiss, it get invad by ab follow by a; if it is too inflex, forc node to choos just on of a or b, it get destroi by a cascad of direct convers to a. but if it ha the right balanc in the valu of r, then the adopt of a come to a stop at a bilingu boundari where node adopt ab. move beyond specif graph g, we find that thi non-convex hold in a much more gener sens as well, by consid the  gener epidem region Ω = ∪gΩ(g). for ani given valu of Δ, the region Ω is a complic union of bound and unbound  polygon, and we do not have a simpl close-form descript for it. howev, we can show via a potenti function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belong to Ω. moreov, we can show the exist of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 . on the other hand, consider of the epidem region for the infinit line show that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r suffici larg. henc, neither Ω nor it complement is convex in the posit quadrant. final, we also extend a character that morri gave for the contagion threshold [13], produc a somewhat more intric character of the region Ω(g). in morri"s set, without an ab strategi, he show that a cannot becom epidem with  paramet q if and onli if everi cofinit set of node contain a subset s that function as a well-connect commun: everi node in s ha at least a (1 − q) fraction of it neighbor in s. in other word, tightli-knit commun ar the natur obstacl to  diffus in hi set. with the ab strategi as a further option, a more complex structur becom the obstacl: we show that a cannot  becom epidem with paramet (q, r) if and onli if everi cofinit set contain a structur consist of a tightli-knit commun with a particular kind of interfac of neighbor node. we show that such a structur allow node to adopt ab at the interfac and b insid the commun itself, prevent the further spread of a; and convers, thi is the onli wai for the spread of a to be block. the analysi underli the character theorem yield a number of other consequ; a basic on is, roughli speak, that the outcom of best-respons updat is independ of the  order in which the updat ar sequenc (provid onli that each node attempt to updat itself infinit often). further extens. anoth wai to model compat and  interoper in diffus model is through the off-diagon term repres the payoff for interact between a node adopt a and a node adopt b. rather than set these to 0, we can  consid set them to a valu x ≤ min(q, 1 − q). we find that for the case of two technolog, the model doe not becom more gener, in that ani such instanc is equival, by a re-scale of q and r, to on where x = 0. moreov, us our  character of the region Ω(g) in term of commun and interfac, we show a monotonicti result: if a can becom epidem on a graph g with paramet (q, r, x), and then x is increas, then a can still becom epidem with the new paramet. we also consid the effect of these off-diagon term in an  extens to k > 2 compet technolog; for technolog x and y , let qx denot the payoff from an x-x interact on an edg and qxy denot the payoff from an x-y interact on an edg. we consid a set in which two technolog b and c, which initi coexist with qbc = 0, face the introduct of a third, better technolog a at a finit set of node. we show an exampl in which b and c both surviv in equilibrium if thei set qbc in a particular rang of valu, but not if thei set qbc too low or too high to lie in thi rang. thu, in even in a basic diffus model with three technolog, on find case in which two firm have an incent to adopt a limit strateg allianc, partial increas their interoper to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2. model we now develop some further notat and definit that will be us for express the model. recal that we have an infinit Δ-regular graph g, and strategi a, b, and ab that ar us in a coordin game on each edg. for edg (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if on of the two node choos strategi a and the other choos strategi b; 1 − q if on choos strategi a and the other choos either a or ab; q if on choos strategi b and the other choos either b or ab; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choos strategi ab. the overal payoff of an agent v is the sum of the abov valu over all neighbor w of v, minu a cost which is 0 if v choos a or b and c = rΔ if she choos ab. we refer to the overal game, plai by all node in g, as a contagion game, and denot it us the tupl (g, q, r). thi game can have mani nash equilibria. in particular, the two state where everybodi us technolog a or everybodi us technolog b ar both equilibria of thi game. as discuss in the previou section, we ar interest in the dynam of reach an equilibrium in thi game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possibl to move from an all-b equilibrium to an all-a equilibrium by chang the strategi of a finit number of agent, and follow a sequenc of best-respons move. we provid a formal descript of thi question via the  follow two definit. definit 2.1. consid a contagion game (g, q, r). a state in thi game is a strategi profil s : v (g) → {a, b, ab}. for two state s and s and a vertex v ∈ v (g), if start from state s and let v plai her best-respons move (break ti in favor of a and then ab) we get to the state s , we write s v → s . similarli, for two state s and s and a finit sequenc s = v1, v2, . . . , vk of vertic of g (where vi"s ar not necessarili distinct), we sai s s → s if there is a sequenc of state s1, . . . , sk−1 such that s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · sk−1 vk → s . for an infinit sequenc s = v1, v2, . . . of vertic of g, we denot the subsequ v1, v2, . . . , vk by sk. we sai s s → s for two state s and s if for everi vertex v ∈ v (g) there exist a k0(v) such that for everi k > k0(v), s sk → sk for a state sk with sk(v) = s (v). definit 2.2. for t ⊆ v (g), we denot by st the strategi profil that assign a to everi agent in t and b to everi agent in v (g) \ t. we sai that technolog a can becom an epidem in the game (g, q, r) if there is a finit set t of node in g (call the seed set) and a sequenc s of vertic in v (g) \ t (where each vertex can appear more than onc) such that st s → sv (g), i.e., endow agent in t with technolog a and let other agent plai their best respons accord to schedul s would lead everi agent to eventu adopt strategi a.2 the abov definit requir that the all-a equilibrium be  reachabl from the initi state by at least on schedul s of best-respons move. in fact, we will show in section 4 that if a can becom an epidem in a game, then for everi schedul of best-respons move of the node in v (g) \ t in which each node is schedul an infinit number of time, eventu all node adopt strategi a.3 3. exampl we begin by consid some basic exampl that yield  epidem region with the kind of non-convex properti discuss 2 note that in our definit we assum that agent in t ar endow with the strategi a at the begin. altern, on can defin the notion of epidem by allow agent in t to be endow with ani combin of ab and a, or with just ab. howev, the differ between these definit is rather minor and our result carri over with littl or no chang to these altern model. 3 note that we assum agent in the seed set t cannot chang their strategi. 0−1 1 2 figur 2: the thick line graph in section 1. we first discuss a natur Δ-regular gener of the infinit line graph, and for thi on we work out the complet analysi that describ the region Ω(g), the set of all pair (q, r) for which the technolog a can becom an epidem. we then  describ, without the accompani detail analysi, the epidem region for the infinit Δ-regular tree and for the two-dimension grid. the infinit line and the thick line graph. for a given even  integ Δ, we defin the thick line graph lΔ as follow: the vertex set of thi graph is z × {1, 2, . . . , Δ/2}, where z is the set of all integ. there is an edg between vertic (x, i) and (x , i ) if and onli if |x − x | = 1. for each x ∈ z, we call the set of vertic {(x, i) : i ∈ {1, . . . , Δ/2} the x"th group of vertic. figur 2 show a pictur of l6 now, assum that start from a posit where everi node us the strategi b, we endow all agent in a group (sai, group 0) with the strategi a. consid the decis face by the agent in group 1, who have their right-hand neighbor us b and their left-hand neighbor us a. for these agent, the payoff of strategi a, b, and ab ar (1 − q)Δ/2, qΔ/2, and Δ/2 − rΔ, respect. therefor, if q ≤ 1 2 and q ≤ 2r, the best respons of such an agent is a. henc, if the abov  inequ hold and we let agent in group 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . plai their best respons in thi order, then a will becom an epidem. also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best respons of an agent with her neighbor on on side plai a and neighbor on the other side plai b is the strategi ab. therefor, if we let agent in group 1 and −1 chang to their best respons, thei would switch their strategi to ab. after thi, agent in group 2 will see ab on their left and b on their right. for these agent (and similarli for the agent in group −2), the payoff of strategi a, b, and ab ar (1−q)Δ/2, qΔ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))Δ/2− rΔ, respect. therefor, if max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 1 − q and max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 2q, or equival, if 2r ≤ q and q + r ≤ 1 2 , the best respons of such an agent is ab. henc, if the abov inequ hold and we let agent in group 2, −2, 3, −3 . . . plai their best respons in thi order, then everi agent (except for agent in group 0) switch to ab. next, if we let agent in group 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . chang their strategi again, for q ≤ 1/2,  everi agent will switch to strategi a, and henc a becom an  epidem.4 4 strictli speak, sinc we defin a schedul of move as a singl infinit sequenc of vertic in v (g) \ t, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . is not a valid schedul.  howev, sinc vertic of g have finit degre, it is not hard to see that ani order of a multiset contain ani (possibl infinit) 78 1/20 r q 0 1/4 3/16 1/12 1/4 figur 3: epidem region for the infinit grid 1/20 1/Δ r q 0 1/Δ figur 4: epidem region for the infinit Δ-regular tree the abov argument show that for ani combin of (q, r) paramet in the mark region in figur 1, technolog a can becom an epidem. it is not hard to see that for point outsid thi region, a cannot becom epidem. further exampl: tree and grid. figur 3 and 4 show the epidem region for the infinit grid and the infinit Δ-regular tree. note thei also exhibit non-convex. 4. character in thi section, we character equilibrium properti of  contagion game. to thi end, we must first argu that contagion game in fact have well-defin and stabl equilibria. we then discuss some respect in which the equilibrium reach from an initi state is essenti independ of the order in which best-respons  updat ar perform. we begin with the follow lemma, which prove that agent eventu converg to a fix strategi, and so the final state of a game is well-defin by it initi state and an infinit sequenc of move. specif, we prove that onc an agent decid to adopt technolog a, she never discard it, and onc she decid to discard technolog b, she never re-adopt it. thu, after an infinit number of best-respons move, each agent converg to a singl strategi. lemma 4.1. consid a contagion game (g, q, r) and a  (possibl infinit) subset t ⊆ v (g) of agent. let st be the strategi profil assign a to everi agent in t and b to everi agent in v (g) \ t. let s = v1, v2, . . . be a (possibl infinit) sequenc of number of copi of each vertex of v (g) \ t can be turn into an equival schedul of move. for exampl, the sequenc 1, −1, 2, −2, 1, −1, 3, −3, 2, −2, . . . give the same outcom as 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . in the thick line exampl. agent in v (g) \ t and consid the sequenc of state s1, s2, . . . obtain by allow agent to plai their best-respons in the order defin by s (i.e., s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · ). then for everi i, on of the follow hold: • si(vi+1) = b and si+1(vi+1) = a, • si(vi+1) = b and si+1(vi+1) = ab, • si(vi+1) = ab and si+1(vi+1) = a, • si(vi+1) = si+1(vi+1). proof. let x >k v y indic that agent v (weakli) prefer strategi x to strategi y in state sk. for ani k let zk a, zk b, and zk ab be the number of neighbor of v with strategi a, b, and ab in state sk, respect. thu, for agent v in state sk, 1. a >k v b if (1 − q)(zk a + zk ab) is greater than q(zk b + zk ab), 2. a >k v ab if (1− q)(zk a + zk ab) is greater than (1− q)zk a + qzk b + max(q, 1 − q)zk ab − Δr, 3. and ab >k v b if (1−q)zk a +qzk b +max(q, 1−q)zk ab −Δr is greater than q(zk b + zk ab). suppos the lemma is fals and consid the smallest i such that the lemma is violat. let v = vi+1 be the agent who plai her best respons at time i. thu, either 1. si(v) = a and si+1(v) = b, or 2. si(v) = a and si+1(v) = ab, or 3. si(v) = ab and si+1(v) = b. we show that in the third case, agent v could not have been plai a best respons. the other case ar similar. in the third case, we have si(v) = ab and si+1(v) = b. as si(v) = ab, there must be a time j < i where sj v → sj+1 and sj+1(v) = ab. sinc thi wa a best-respons move for v,  inequ 3 impli that (1 − q)zj a + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj ab ≥ Δr. furthermor, as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is  violat, zi a ≥ zj a and zj ab − zi ab ≤ zi a − zj a. thu, the chang q in payoff between ab and b (plu Δr) is q ≡ (1 − q)zi a + max(0, 1 − 2q)zi ab ≥ (1 − q)(zi a − zj a + zj a) + max(0, 1 − 2q)(zj ab − zi a + zj a) = (1 − q)zj a + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj ab + max(q, 1 − q)(zi a − zj a) ≥ (1 − q)zj a + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj ab ≥ Δr, and so, by inequ 3, b can not be a better respons than ab for v in state si. corollari 4.2. for everi infinit sequenc s of vertic in v (g) \ t, there is a uniqu state s such that s0 s → s, where s0 denot the initi state where everi vertex in t plai a and everi vertex in v (g) \ t plai b. such a state s is call the outcom of the game (g, q, r) start from t and us the schedul s. equival of best-respons schedul. lemma 4.1 show that the outcom of a game is well-defin and uniqu. the follow theorem show that the outcom is also invari to the dynam, or sequenc of best-respons move, under certain mild condit. the first theorem state that if the all-a equilibrium is the outcom of a game for some (unconstrain) schedul, then it is the outcom for ani schedul in which each vertex is allow to move infinit mani time. the second theorem state that the outcom of a game is the same for ani schedul of move in which everi vertex move infinit mani time. 79 theorem 4.3. consid a contagion game (g, q, r), a subset t ⊆ v (g), and a schedul s of vertic in v (g) \ t such that the outcom of the game is the all-a equilibrium. then for ani schedul s of vertic in v (g) \ t such that everi vertex in thi set occur infinit mani time, the outcom of the game us the schedul s is also the all-a equilibrium. proof. note that s is a subsequ of s . let π : s → s be the inject map s to it subsequ in s . we show for ani vi ∈ s, if vi switch to ab, then π(vi) switch to ab or a, and if vi switch to a, then π(vi) switch to a (here v switch to x mean that after the best-respons move, the strategi of v is x). suppos not and let i be the smallest integ such that the statement doesn"t hold. let za, zb, and zab be the number of neighbor of vi with strategi a, b, and ab in the current state defin by s. defin za,zb, and zab similarli for s . then, by lemma 4.1 and the choic of i, za ≥ za, zb ≤ zb, zab − zab ≤ zb − zb, and zab − zab ≤ za − za. now suppos vi switch to ab. then the same sequenc of inequ as in lemma 4.1 show that ab is a better respons than b for π(vi) (although a might be the best respons) and so π(vi) switch to either ab or a. the other case (vi switch to a) is similar. theorem 4.4. consid a contagion game (g, q, r) and a  subset t ⊆ v (g). then for everi two schedul s and s of vertic in v (g)\t such that everi vertex in thi set occur infinit mani time in each of these schedul, the outcom of the game us these schedul ar the same. proof. the proof of thi theorem is similar to that of  theorem 4.3 and is defer to the full version of the paper. block structur. final, we prove the character  mention in the introduct: a cannot becom epidem if and onli if (g, q, r) possess a certain kind of block structur. thi  result gener morri"s theorem on the contagion threshold for hi model; in hi case without ab as a possibl strategi, a simpler kind of commun structur wa the obstacl to a becom epidem. we begin by defin the block structur. definit 4.5. consid a contagion game (g, q, r). a pair (sab, sb) of disjoint subset of v (g) is call a block  structur for thi game if for everi vertex v ∈ sab, degsb (v) > r q Δ, and for everi vertex v ∈ sb, (1 − q) degsb (v) + min(q, 1 − q) degsab (v) > (1 − q − r)Δ, and degsb (v) + q degsab (v) > (1 − q)Δ, where deg(v) denot the number of neighbor of v in the set s. theorem 4.6. for everi contagion game (g, q, r),  technolog a cannot becom epidem in thi game if and onli if everi co-finit set of vertic of g contain a block structur. proof. we first show that if everi co-finit set of vertic of g contain a block structur, then technolog a cannot becom epidem. let t be ani finit set of vertic endow with  technolog a, and let (sab, sb) be the block structur contain in v (g) \ t. we claim that in the outcom of the game for ani  sequenc s of move, the vertic in sab have strategi b or ab and the vertic in sb have strategi b. suppos not and let v be the first vertex in sequenc s to violat thi (i.e., v ∈ sab switch to a or v ∈ sb switch to a or ab). suppos v ∈ sab (the other case ar similar). let za, zb, and zab denot the number of neighbor of v with strategi a, b, and ab respect. as v is the first vertex violat the claim, za ≤ Δ− degsb (v)− degsab (v) and zb ≥ degsb (v). we show ab is a better strategi than a for v. to show thi, we must prove that (1 − q)za + qzb + max(q, 1 − q)zab − Δr > (1 − q)(za + zab) or, equival, the quantiti q ≡ qzb + max(2q − 1, 0)zab − Δr > 0: q = (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ − max(2q − 1, 0)za +(q − max(2q − 1, 0))zb ≥ (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ + min(q, 1 − q) degsb (v) − max(2q − 1, 0)(Δ − degsb (v) − degsab (v)) ≥ [min(q, 1 − q) + max(2q − 1, 0)] degsb (v) − rΔ = q degsb (v) − rΔ > 0, where the last inequ hold by the definit of the block structur. we next show that a cannot becom epidem if and onli if  everi co-finit set of vertic contain a block structur. to  construct a block structur for the complement of a finit set t of vertic, endow t with strategi a and consid the outcom of the game for ani sequenc s which schedul each vertex an  infinit number of time. let sab be the set of vertic with  strategi ab and sb be the set of vertic with strategi b in thi outcom. note for ani v ∈ sab, ab is a best-respons and so is strictli better than strategi a, i.e. q degsb (v) + max(q, 1 − q) degsab −Δr > (1− q) degsab (v), from where it follow that degsb (v) > (rΔ)/q. the inequ for the vertic v ∈ sb can be deriv in a similar manner. a corollari to the abov theorem is that for everi infinit graph g, the epidem region in the q-r plane for thi graph is a finit union of bound and unbound polygon. thi is becaus the inequ defin block structur ar linear inequ in q and r, and the coeffici of these inequ can take onli finit mani valu. 5. non-epidem region in gener graph the character theorem in the previou section provid on wai of think about the region Ω(g), the set of all (q, r) pair for which a can becom epidem in the game (g, q, r). we now consid the region Ω = ∪gΩ(g), where the union is taken over all infinit Δ-regular graph; thi is the set of all (q, r)  valu for which a can becom epidem in some Δ-regular network. the analysi here us lemma 4.1 and an argument base on an appropri defin potenti function. the first theorem show that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belong to Ω. sinc q > 1 2 impli that the incumb technolog b is superior, it impli that in ani network, a superior incumb will surviv for ani level of compat. theorem 5.1. for everi Δ-regular graph g and paramet q and r, the technolog a cannot becom an epidem in the game (g, q, r) if q > 1/2. proof. assum, for contradict, that there is a Δ-regular graph g and valu q > 1/2 and r, a set t of vertic of g that ar initi endow with the strategi a, and a schedul s of move for vertic in v (g) \ t such that thi sequenc lead to an all-a equilibrium. we deriv a contradict by defin a non-neg 80 potenti function that start with a finit valu and show that after each best respons by some vertex the valu of thi function decreas by some posit amount bound awai from zero. at ani state in the game, let xa,b denot the number of edg in g that have on endpoint us strategi a and the other endpoint  us strategi b. furthermor, let nab denot the number of agent us the strategi ab. the potenti function is the follow: qxa,b + cnab (recal c = Δr is the cost of adopt two technolog). sinc g ha bound degre and the initi set t is finit, the initi valu of thi potenti function is finit. we now show that everi best respons move decreas the valu of thi function by some posit amount bound awai from zero. by lemma 4.1, we onli need to analyz the effect on the potenti function for move of the sort describ by the lemma. therefor we have three case: a node u switch from strategi b to ab, a node u switch from strategi ab to a, or a node u switch from strategi b to a. we consid the first case here; the proof for the other case ar similar. suppos a node u with strategi b switch to strategi ab. let zab, za, and zb denot the number of neighbor of u in partit piec ab, a, and b respect. thu, recal that q > 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategi b is q(zab + zb) wherea hi payoff with strategi ab is q(zab + zb) + (1 − q)za − c. in order for thi strateg chang to improv u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − q)za ≥ c. (1) now, notic that such a strateg chang on the part of u induc a chang in the potenti function of −qza + c as za edg ar remov from the xa,b edg between a and b and the size of partit piec ab is increas by on. thi chang will be  neg so long as za > c/q which hold by inequ 1 as q > (1−q) for q > 1/2. furthermor, as za can take onli finit mani valu (za ∈ {0, 1, . . . , Δ}), thi chang is bound awai from zero. thi next theorem show that for ani Δ, there is a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 . thi mean that there is a set of the  paramet q and r for which the new technolog a is superior, but for which the incumb technolog is guarante to surviv regardless of the underli network. theorem 5.2. there exist q < 1/2 and r such that for everi contagion game (g, q, r), a cannot becom epidem. proof. the proof is base on the potenti function from  theorem 5.1: qxa,b + cnab. we first show that if q is close enough to 1/2 and r is chosen  appropri, thi potenti function is non-increas. specif, let q = 1 2 − 1 64Δ and c = rΔ = α, where α is ani irrat number strictli between 3/64 and q. again, there ar three case correspond to the three possibl strategi chang for a node u. let zab, za, and zb denot the number of neighbor of node u in partit piec ab, a, and b respect. case 1: b → ab. recal that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategi b is q(zab + zb) wherea hi payoff with strategi ab is (1 − q)(zab + za) + qzb − c. in order for thi strateg chang to improv u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zab + (1 − q)za ≥ c. (2) now, notic that such a strateg chang on the part of u induc a chang in the potenti function of −qza + c as za edg ar remov from the xa,b edg between a and b and the size of partit piec ab is increas by on. thi chang will be  nonposit so long as za ≥ c/q. by inequ 2 and the fact that za is an integ, za ≥ ‰ c 1 − q − (1 − 2q)zab 1 − q ı . substitut our choic of paramet, (and note that q ∈ [1/4, 1/2] and zab ≤ Δ), we see that the term insid the ceil is less than 1 and at least 3/64 3/4 − 1/32 1/2 > 0. thu, the ceil is on, which is larger than c/q. case 2: ab → a. recal that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategi ab is (1 − q)(zab + za) + qzb − c wherea her payoff with strategi a is (1 − q)(zab + za). in order for thi strateg chang to improv u"s payoff, it must be the case that qzb ≤ c. (3) such a strateg chang on the part of u induc a chang in the  potenti function of qzb −c as zb edg ar ad to the xa,b edg between a and b and the size of partit piec ab is decreas by on. thi chang will be non-posit so long as zb ≤ c/q, which hold by inequ 3. case 3: b → a. note u"s payoff with strategi b is q(zab + zb) wherea hi payoff with strategi a is (1 − q)(zab + za). in order for thi strateg chang to improv u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zab ≥ qzb − (1 − q)za. (4) such a strateg chang on the part of u induc a chang in the potenti function of q(zb − za) as za edg ar remov and zb edg ar ad to the xa,b edg between a and b. thi chang will be neg so long as zb < za. by inequ 4 and the fact that za is an integ, za ≥  qzb 1 − q + (1 − 2q)zab 1 − q . substitut our choic of paramet, it is easi to see that the term insid the floor is at most zb + 1/4, and so the floor is at most zb as zb is an integ. we have shown the potenti function is non-increas for our choic of q and c. thi impli the potenti function is eventu constant. as c is irrat and the  remain term ar alwai ration, both nab and xa,b must remain constant for the potenti function as a whole to remain constant. suppos a is epidem in thi region. as nab is constant and a is epidem, it must be that nab = 0. thu, the onli move involv a node u switch from strategi b to strategi a. in order for xa,b to be constant for such move, it must be that za (the number of neighbor of u in a) equal zb (the number of neighbor of u in b) and, as nab = 0, we have that za = zb = Δ/2. thu, the payoff of u for strategi a is (1 − q)za < Δ/4 wherea her payoff for strategi ab is (1−q)za +qzb −c > Δ/2−q ≥ Δ/4. thi contradict the assumpt that u is plai her best respons by switch to a. 6. limit compat we now consid some further wai of model compat and interoper. we first consid two technolog, as in the previou section, and introduc off-diagon payoff to captur a posit benefit in direct a-b interact. we find that thi is 81 in fact no more gener than the model with zero payoff for a-b interact. we then consid extens to three technolog, identifi situat in which two coexist incumb technolog mai or mai not want to increas their mutual compat in the face of a new, third technolog. two technolog. a natur relax of the two-technolog model is to introduc (small) posit payoff for a-b interact; that is, cross-technolog commun yield some lesser valu to both agent. we can model thi us a variabl xab repres the payoff gather by an agent with technolog a when her  neighbor ha technolog b, and similarli, a variabl xba repres the payoff gather by an agent with b when her neighbor ha a. here we consid the special case in which these off-diagon  entri ar symmetr, i.e., xab = xba = x. we also assum that x < q ≤ 1 − q. we first show that the game with off-diagon entri is  equival to a game without these entri, under a simpl re-scale of q and r. note that if we re-scale all payoff by either an addit or a multipl constant, the behavior of the game is unaffect. given a game with off-diagon entri parameter by q, r and x, consid subtract x from all payoff, and scale up by a factor of 1/(1 − 2x). as can be seen by examin tabl 1, the result payoff ar exactli those of a game without off-diagon entri, parameter by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). thu the addit of symmetr off-diagon entri doe not  expand the class of game be consid. tabl 1 repres the payoff in the coordin game in term of these paramet. nevertheless, we can still ask how the addit of an off-diagon entri might affect the outcom of ani particular game. as the  follow exampl show, increas compat between two  technolog can allow on technolog that wa not initi epidem to becom so. exampl 6.1. consid the contagion game plai on a thick line graph (see section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8. in thi case, a is not epidem, as can be seen by examin figur 1, sinc 2r < q and q + r > 1/2. howev, if we insert symmetr off-diagon payoff x = 1/4, we have a new game, equival to a game parameter by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4. sinc q < 1/2 and q < 2r , a is epidem in thi game, and thu also in the game with limit compat. we now show that gener, if a is the superior technolog (i.e., q < 1/2), ad a compat term x can onli help a spread. theorem 6.2. let g be a game without compat,  parameter by r and q on a particular network. let g be that same game, but with an ad symmetr compat term x. if a is epidem for g, then a is epidem for g . proof. we will show that ani block structur in g is also a block structur in g. by our character theorem,  theorem 4.6, thi impli the desir result. we have that g is  equival to a game without compat parameter by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). consid a block structur (sb, sab) for g . we know that for ani v ∈ sab, q dsb (v) > r Δ. thu qdsb (v) > (q − x)dsb (v) = q (1 − 2x)dsb (v) > r (1 − 2x)Δ = rΔ, as requir for a block structur in g. similarli, the two  block structur constraint for v ∈ sb ar onli strengthen when we move from g to g. more than two technolog. given the complex structur  inher in contagion game with two technolog, the understand of contagion game with three or more technolog is larg open. here we indic some of the technic issu that come up with multipl technolog, through a seri of initi result. the  basic set-up we studi is on in which two incumb technolog b and c ar initi coexist, and a third technolog a, superior to both, is introduc initi at a finit set of node. we first present a theorem state that for ani even Δ, there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two  incumb technolog b and c mai find it benefici to increas their compat so as to prevent get wipe out by the new  superior technolog a. in particular, we consid a situat in which initi, two technolog b and c with zero compat ar at a stabl state. by a stabl state, we mean that no finit  perturb of the current state can lead to an epidem for either b or c. we also have a technolog a that is superior to both b and c, and can becom epidem by forc a singl node to choos a. howev, by increas their compat, b and c can maintain their stabil and resist an epidem from a. let qa denot the payoff to two adjac node that both choos technolog a, and defin qb and qc analog. we will assum qa > qb > qc . we also assum that r, the cost of select addit technolog, is suffici larg so as to ensur that node never adopt more than on technolog. final, we  consid a compat paramet qbc that repres the payoff to two adjac node when on select b and the other select c. thu our contagion game is now describ by five paramet (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ). theorem 6.3. for ani even Δ ≥ 12, there is a Δ-regular graph g, an initi state s, and valu qa, qb, qc , and qbc , such that • s is an equilibrium in both (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) and (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ), • neither b nor c can becom epidem in either (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) or (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ) start from state s, • a can becom epidem (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) start from state s, and • a can not becom epidem in (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ) start from state s. proof. (sketch.) given Δ, defin g by start with an infinit grid and connect each node to it nearest Δ − 2 neighbor that ar in the same row. the initi state s assign strategi b to even row and strategi c to odd row. let qa = 4k2 + 4k + 1/2, qb = 2k + 2, qc = 2k + 1, and qbc = 2k + 3/4. the first, third, and fourth claim in the theorem can be verifi by check the correspond inequ. the second claim follow from the first and the observ that the altern row contain ani plausibl epidem from grow vertic. the abov theorem show that two technolog mai both be abl to surviv the introduct of a new technolog by increas their level of compat with each other. as on might expect, 82 a b ab a (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r) b (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r) ab (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r) tabl 1: the payoff in the coordin game. entri (x, y) in row i, column j indic that the row player get a payoff of x and the column player get a payoff of y when the row player plai strategi i and the column player plai strategi j. there ar case when increas compat between two  technolog help on technolog at the expens of the other.  surprisingli, howev, there ar also instanc in which compat is in fact harm to both parti; the next exampl consid a fix initi configur with technolog a, b and c that is at  equilibrium when qbc = 0. howev, if thi compat term is  increas suffici, equilibrium is lost, and a becom epidem. exampl 6.4. consid the union of an infinit two-dimension grid graph with node u(x, y) and an infinit line graph with node v(y). add an edg between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y. for thi  network, we consid the initi configur in which all v(y) node select a, and node u(x, y) select b if x < 0 and select c  otherwis. we now defin the paramet of thi game as follow. let qa = 3.95, qb = 1.25, qc = 1, and qbc = 0. it is easili verifi that for these valu, the initi configur given abov is an  equilibrium. howev, now suppos we increas the coordin term, set qbc = 0.9. thi is not an equilibrium, sinc each node of the form u(0, y) now ha an incent to switch from c (gener a payoff of 3.9) to b (therebi gener a payoff of 3.95).  howev, onc these node have adopt b, the best-respons for each node of the form u(1, y) is a (a gener a payoff of 4 where as b onli gener a payoff of 3.95). from here, it is not hard to show that a spread directli throughout the entir network. 7. refer [1] l. blume. the statist mechan of strateg interact. game and econom behavior, 5:387-424, 1993.
