gener valu decomposit and structur multiattribut auction yagil engel and michael p. wellman univers of michigan, comput scienc & engin 2260 hayward st, ann arbor, mi 48109-2121, usa {yagil,wellman}@umich.edu abstract multiattribut auction mechan gener either remain  agnost about trader" prefer, or presum highli restrict form, such as full addit. real prefer often exhibit  depend among attribut, yet mai possess some structur that can be usefulli exploit to streamlin commun and simplifi  oper of a multiattribut auction. we develop such a structur us the theori of measur valu function, a cardin util represent base on an underli order over prefer  differ. a set of local condit independ relat over such differ support a gener addit prefer  represent, which decompos util across overlap cluster of relat attribut. we introduc an iter auction mechan that maintain price on local cluster of attribut rather than the full space of joint configur. when trader" prefer ar  consist with the auction"s gener addit structur, the  mechan produc approxim optim alloc, at approxim vcg price. categori and subject descriptor: j.4 [comput  applic]: social and behavior scienc-econom gener term: algorithm, econom 1. introduct multiattribut trade mechan extend tradit, price-onli mechan by facilit the negoti over a set of predefin attribut repres variou non-price aspect of the deal. rather than negoti over a fulli defin good or servic, a  multiattribut mechan delai commit to specif configur until the most promis candid ar identifi. for exampl, a procur depart of a compani mai us a multiattribut auction to select a supplier of hard drive. supplier offer mai be evalu not onli over the price thei offer, but also over variou qualit attribut such as volum, rpm, access time, latenc, transfer rate, and so on. in addit, supplier mai offer differ contract condit such as warranti, deliveri time, and servic. in order to account for trader" prefer, the auction  mechan must extract evalu inform over a complex domain of multidimension configur. construct and  commun a complet prefer specif can be a sever burden for even a moder number of attribut, therefor practic  multiattribut auction must either accommod partial specif, or support compact express of prefer assum some  simplifi form. by far the most popular multiattribut form to adopt is the simplest: an addit represent where overal valu is a linear combin of valu associ with each attribut. for  exampl, sever recent propos for iter multiattribut auction [2, 3, 8, 19] requir addit prefer represent. such addit reduc the complex of prefer  specif exponenti (compar to the gener discret case), but  preclud express of ani interdepend among the attribut. in practic, howev, interdepend among natur attribut ar quit common. for exampl, the buyer mai exhibit complementari prefer for size and access time (sinc the perform effect is more salient if much data is involv), or mai view a strong  warranti as a good substitut for high reliabl rate. similarli, the seller"s product characterist (such as increas access time is harder for larger hard drive) can easili violat addit. in such case an addit valu function mai not be abl to provid even a reason approxim of real prefer. on the other hand, fulli gener model ar intract, and it is reason to expect multiattribut prefer to exhibit some structur. our goal, therefor, is to identifi the subtler yet more wide applic structur represent, and exploit these  properti of prefer in trade mechan. we propos an iter auction mechan base on just such a flexibl prefer structur. our approach is inspir by the  design of an iter multiattribut procur auction for addit prefer, due to park and kalagnanam (pk) [19]. pk  propos two type of iter auction: the first (nld) make no  assumpt about trader" prefer, and let seller bid on the full multidimension attribut space. becaus nld maintain an  exponenti price structur, it is suitabl onli for small domain. the other auction (ad) assum addit buyer valuat and seller cost function. it collect sell bid per attribut level and for a singl  discount term. the price of a configur is defin as the sum of the price of the chosen attribut level minu the discount. the auction we propos also support compact price space,  albeit for level of cluster of attribut rather than singleton. we emploi a prefer decomposit base on gener addit independ (gai), a model flexibl enough to accommod  interdepend to the exact degre of accuraci desir, yet  provid a compact function form to the extent that interdepend can be limit. given it root in multiattribut util theori [13], 227 the gai condit is defin with respect to the expect util function. to appli it for model valu for certain outcom, therefor, requir a reinterpret for prefer under certainti. to thi end, we exploit the fact that auction outcom ar associ with continu price, which provid a natur scale for assess magnitud of prefer. we first lai out a represent framework for prefer that captur, in addit to simpl order among attribut  configur valu, the differ in the willing to pai (wtp) for each. that is, we should be abl not onli to compar outcom but also decid whether the differ in qualiti is worth a given differ in price. next, we build a direct, formal justifi link from  prefer statement over price outcom to a gener addit decomposit of the wtp function. after lai out thi  infrastructur, we emploi thi represent tool for the develop of a multiattribut iter auction mechan that allow trader to  express their complex prefer in gai format. we then studi the auction"s alloc, comput, and practic properti. in section 2 we present essenti background on our  represent framework, the measur valu function (mvf). section 3 develop new multiattribut structur for mvf, support  gener addit decomposit. next, we show the applic of the theoret framework to prefer in trade. the rest of the paper is devot to the propos auction mechan. 2. multiattribut prefer as mention, most tool facilit express of multiattribut valu for trade applic assum that agent" prefer can be repres in an addit form. by wai of background, we start by introduc the formal prerequisit justifi the addit  represent, as provid by multiattribut util theori. we then present the gener addit form, and develop the formal  underpin for measur valu need to extend thi model to the case of choic under certainti. 2.1 preferenti independ let Θ denot the space of possibl outcom, with a  prefer relat (weak total order) over Θ. let a = {a0, . . . , am} be a set of attribut describ Θ. capit letter denot subset of variabl, small letter (with or without numer subscript)  denot specif variabl, and ¯x denot the complement of x with respect to a. we indic specif variabl assign with prime sign or superscript. to repres an instanti of subset x, y at the same time we us a sequenc of instanti symbol, as in x y . definit 1. a set of attribut y ⊂ a is preferenti  independ (pi) of it complement z = a \ y if the condit prefer order over y given a fix level z0 of z is the same regardless of the choic of z0 . in other word, the prefer order over the project of a on the attribut in y is the same for ani instanti of the attribut in z. definit 2. a = {a1, . . . , am} is mutual preferenti independ (mpi) if ani subset of a is preferenti independ of it complement. the prefer relat when no uncertainti is model is  usual repres by a valu function v [17]. the follow  fundament result greatli simplifi the valu function represent. theorem 1 ([9]). a prefer order over set of attribut a ha an addit valu function represent v(a1, . . . , am) = mx i=1 vi(ai) iff a is mutual preferenti independ. essenti, the addit form us in trade mechan assum mutual preferenti independ over the full set of attribut,  includ the monei attribut. intuit that mean that willing to pai for valu of an attribut or attribut cannot be affect by the valu of other attribut. a cardin valu function repres an order over certain outcom need not in gener coincid with the cardin util function that repres prefer over lotteri or expect util (eu). nevertheless, eu function mai possess structur  properti analog to that for valu function, such as addit  decomposit. sinc the present work doe not involv decis under uncertainti, we do not provid a full exposit of the eu concept. howev we do make frequent refer to the follow addit independ relat. definit 3. let x, y, z be a partit of the set of attribut a. x and y ar condition addit independ given z,  denot as cai(x, y | z), if prefer over lotteri on a depend onli on their margin condit probabl distribut over x and y . definit 4. let i1, . . . , ig ⊆ a such that sg i=1 ii = a. i1, . . . , ig ar call gener addit independ (gai) if  prefer over lotteri on a depend onli on their margin  distribut over i1, . . . , ig. an (expect) util function u(·) can be decompos addit accord to it (possibl overlap) gai sub-configur. theorem 2 ([13]). let i1, . . . , ig be gai. then there exist function f1, . . . , fg such that u(a1, . . . , am) = g x r=1 fr(ir). (1) what is now known as the gai condit wa origin  introduc by fishburn [13] for eu, and wa name gai and brought to the attent of ai research by bacchu and grove [1].  graphic model and elicit procedur for gai decompos util were develop for eu [4, 14, 6], for a cardin represent of the ordin valu function [15], and for an ordin prefer  relat correspond to a tcp-net structur by brafman et al. [5]. apart from the work on gai in the context of prefer handl that were discuss abov, gai have been recent us in the  context of mechan design by hyafil and boutili [16], as an aid in direct revel mechan. as shown by bacchu and grove [1], gai structur can be  identifi base on a set of cai condit, which ar much easier to detect and verifi. in gener, util function mai exhibit gai structur not base on cai. howev, to date all propos for  reason and elicit util in gai form take advantag of the gai structur primarili to the extent that it repres a collect of cai condit. for exampl, gai tree [14] emploi triangul of the cai map, and braziuna and boutili"s [6] condit set cj of a set ij correspond to the cai separ set of ij. sinc the cai condit is also defin base on prefer over lotteri, we cannot appli bacchu and grove"s result  without first establish an altern framework base on price  outcom. we develop such a framework us the theori of  measur valu function, ultim produc a gai decomposit 228 (eq. 1) of the wtp function. reader interest primarili in the multiattribut auction and will to grant the well-founded of the prefer structur mai skip down to section 5. 2.2 measur valu function trade decis repres a special case of decis under  certainti, where choic involv multiattribut outcom and  correspond monetari payment. in such problem, the kei decis often hing on rel valuat of price differ compar to differ in altern configur of good and servic. theoret, price can be treat as just anoth attribut,  howev, such an approach fail to exploit the special charact of the monei dimens, and can significantli add to complex due to the inher continu and typic wide rang of possibl monetari outcom valu. we build on the fundament work of dyer and sarin [10, 11] on measur valu function (mvf). as we show below, wtp  function in a quasi-linear set can be interpret as mvf. howev we first present the mvf framework in a more gener wai, where the measur is not necessarili monetari. we present the  essenti definit and refer to dyer and sarin for more detail background and axiomat treatment. the kei concept is that of prefer differ. let θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ Θ such that θ1 θ2 and ϑ1 ϑ2 . [θ2 , θ1 ] denot the prefer differ between θ2 and θ1 , interpret as the strength, or degre, to which θ2 is  prefer over θ1 . let ∗ denot a prefer order over Θ × Θ. we interpret the statement [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] as the prefer of ϑ2 over ϑ1 is at least as strong as the  prefer of θ2 over θ1 . we us the symbol ∼∗ to repres equal of prefer differ. definit 5. u : d → is a measur valu function (mvf) wrt ∗ if for ani θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ d, [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] ⇔ u(θ2 ) − u(θ1 ) ≤ u(ϑ2 ) − u(ϑ1 ). note that an mvf can also be us as a valu function repres , sinc [θ , θ] ∗ [θ , θ] iff θ θ . definit 6 ([11]). attribut set x ⊂ a is call  differ independ of ¯x if for ani two assign x1 ¯x x2 ¯x , [x1 ¯x , x2 ¯x ] ∼∗ [x1 ¯x , x2 ¯x ] for ani assign ¯x . or, in word, the prefer differ on assign to x given a fix level of ¯x do not depend on the particular level chosen for ¯x. as with addit independ for eu, thi condit is stronger than preferenti independ of x. also analog to eu, mutual preferenti independ combin with other condit lead to addit decomposit of the mvf. moreov, dyer and sarin [11] have defin analog of util independ [17] for mvf, and work out a parallel set of decomposit result. 3. advanc mvf structur 3.1 condit differ independ our first step is to gener definit 6 to a condit  version. definit 7. let x, y, z be a partit of the set of attribut a. x is condition differ independ of y given z,  denot as cdi(x, y | z), if ∀ instanti ˆz, x1 , x2 , y 1 , y 2 [x1 y 1 ˆz, x2 y 1 ˆz] ∼ [x1 y 2 ˆz, x2 y 2 ˆz]. sinc the condit set is alwai the complement, we sometim leav it implicit, us the abbrevi notat cdi(x, y ). cdi lead to a decomposit similar to that obtain from cai [17]. lemma 3. let u(a) be an mvf repres prefer  differ. then cdi(x, y | z) iff u(a) = u(x0 , y, z) + u(x, y 0 , z) − u(x0 , y 0 , z). to complet the analog with cai, we gener lemma 3 as follow. proposit 4. cdi(x, y | z) iff there exist function ψ1(x, z) and ψ2(y, z), such that u(x, y, z) = ψ1(x, z) + ψ2(y, z). (2) an immedi result of proposit 4 is that cdi is a symmetr relat. the condit independ condit is much more  applic than the uncondit on. for exampl, if attribut a ∈ x and b /∈ x ar complement or substitut, x cannot be differ independ of ¯x. howev, x \ {a} mai still be cdi of ¯x given a. 3.2 gai structur for mvf a singl cdi condit decompos the valu function into two part. we seek a finer-grain global decomposit of the util function, similar to that obtain from mutual preferenti  independ. for thi purpos we ar now readi to emploi the result of bacchu and grove [1], who establish that the cai condit ha a perfect map [20]; that is, there exist a graph whose node correspond to the set a, and it node separ reflect exactli the complet set of cai condit on a. moreov, thei show that the util function decompos over the set of maxim cliqu of the perfect map. their proof can be easili adapt to cdi, sinc thei onli reli on the decomposit properti of cai that is also impli by cdi accord to proposit 4. theorem 5. let g = (a, e) be a perfect map for the cdi condit on a. then u(a) = g x r=1 fr(ir), (3) where i1, . . . , ig ar (overlap) subset of a, each  correspond to a maxim cliqu of g. given theorem 5, we can now identifi an mvf gai structur from a collect of cdi condit. the cdi condit, in turn, ar particularli intuit to detect when the prefer differ carri a direct interpret, as in the case with monetari  differ discuss below. moreov, the assumpt or detect of cdi condit can be perform increment, until the mvf is decompos to a reason dimens. thi is in contrast with the fulli addit decomposit of mvf that requir mutual  preferenti independ [11]. theorem 5 defin a decomposit structur, but to repres the actual mvf we need to specifi the function over the cliqu. 229 the next theorem establish that the function constitu of mvf ar the same as those for gai decomposit as defin by fishburn [13] for eu. we adopt the follow convent  notat. let (a0 1, . . . , a0 m) be a predefin vector call the refer outcom. for ani i ⊆ a, the function u([i]) stand for the  project of u(a) to i where the rest of the attribut ar fix at their refer level. theorem 6. let g = (a, e) be a perfect map for the cdi condit on a, and {i1, . . . , ig} a set of maxim cliqu as  defin in theorem 5. then the function decomposit from that theorem can be defin as f1 = u([i1]), and for r = 2, . . . , g (4) fr = u([ir]) + r−1x k=1 (−1)k x 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\ s=1 ii ∩ ir]) the proof directli show that if graph g = (a, e) is a perfect map of cdi, u(a) decompos to a sum over the function defin in (4).1 thu thi proof doe not reli on the decomposit result of theorem 5, onli on the exist of the perfect map. to summar, the result of thi section gener addit mvf theori. in particular it justifi the applic of method recent develop under the eu framework [1, 4, 14, 6] to represent of valu under certainti. 4. willing-to-pai as an mvf 4.1 construct in thi section we appli measur valu to repres  differ of willing to pai for outcom. we assum that the agent ha a prefer order over outcom space, repres by a set of attribut a, and an attribut p repres monetari consequ. note that in evalu a purchas decis, p would correspond to the agent"s monei hold net of the transact (i.e., wealth  after purchas), not the purchas price. an outcom in thi space is repres for exampl by (θ , p ), where θ is an instanti of a and p is a valu of p. we further assum that prefer ar quasi-linear in p, that is there exist a valu function of the form v(a, p) = u(a) + l(p), where l is a posit linear function.2 the quasi-linear form immedi qualifi monei as a  measur of prefer differ, and establish a monetari scale for u(a). definit 8. let v(a, p) = u(a)+l(p) repres , where p is the attribut repres monei. we call u(a) a  willingnessto-pai (wtp) function. note that wtp mai also refer to the seller"s willing to accept function. the wtp u(a) is a cardin function, uniqu up to a  posit linear transform. sinc (θ1, p ) (θ2, p ) ⇔ u(θ1) − u(θ2) ≤ l(p − p ), (where θ1, θ1 ∈ Θ, the domain of a) the wtp function can be us to choos among price outcom. 1 thi proof and most other proof in thi paper ar omit for space consider, and ar avail in an onlin appendix. 2 in mani procur applic, the deal in question ar small rel to the enterpris involv, so the quasi-linear  assumpt is warrant. thi assumpt can be relax to a condit call correspond tradeoff [17], which doe not requir the valu over monei to be linear. to simplifi the present,  howev, we maintain the stronger assumpt. natur, elicit of wtp function is most intuit when  us direct monetari valu. in other word, we elicit a function in which l(p) = p, so v(a, p) = u(a) + p. we defin a refer outcom (θ0 , p0 ), and assum continu of p, for ani assign ˆθ there exist a ˆp such that (ˆθ, ˆp) ∼ (θ0 , p0 ). as v is normal such that v(θ0 , p0 ) = 0, ˆp is interpret as the wtp for ˆθ, or the reserv price of ˆθ. proposit 7. the wtp function is an mvf over differ in the reserv price. we note that the wtp function is us extens in econom, and that all the develop in section 3 could be perform  directli in term of wtp, reli on quasi-linear for prefer measur, and without formal us mvf. thi  formal howev align thi work with the fundament  differ independ theori by dyer and sarin. in addit to facilit the detect of gai structur, the cdi condit support elicit us local queri, similar to how cai is us by braziuna and boutili [6]. we adopt their  definit of condit set of ir, note here sr, as the set of neighbor of attribut in ir not includ the attribut of ir. clearli, sr is the separ set of ir in the cdi map, henc cdi(ir, vr), where vr = a \ (ir ∪ sr). from the definit of cdi, for ani v 1 r , v 2 r we have: u(i1 r s0 r v 1 r ) − u(i2 r s0 r v 1 r ) = u(i1 r s0 r v 2 r ) − u(i2 r s0 r v 2 r ). elicit the wtp function therefor amount to elicit the  util (wtp) of on full outcom (the refer outcom θ0 ), and then obtain the function over each maxim cliqu us monetari differ between it possibl assign (techniqu known as price out [17]), keep the variabl in the condit set fix. these ceteri paribu elicit queri ar local in the sens that the agent doe not need to consid the valu of the rest of the  attribut. furthermor, in elicit mvf we can avoid the global scale step that is requir for eu function. sinc the prefer differ ar extract with respect to specif amount of the attribut p, the util is alreadi scale accord to that extern measur. henc, onc the condit util function u([ij]) ar obtain, we can calcul u(a) accord to (4). thi last step mai requir (in the worst case) comput of a number of term that is exponenti in the number of max cliqu. in practic howev we do not expect the intersect of the cliqu to go that deep; intersect of more than just a few max cliqu would normal be empti. to take advantag of that we can us the search algorithm suggest by braziuna and boutili [6], which effici find all the nonempti intersect for each cliqu. 4.2 optim as shown, the wtp function can be us directli for pairwis comparison of price outcom. anoth prefer queri often treat in the literatur is optim, or choic of best outcom, possibl under constraint. typic decis about exchang of a good or servic exhibit what we call first-order preferenti independ (fopi), under which most or all singl attribut have a natur order of qualiti, independ of the valu of the rest.3 for exampl, when  choos a pc we alwai prefer more memori, faster cpu, longer  warranti, and so on. under fopi, the unconstrain optim of 3 thi should not be mistaken with the highli demand  condit of mutual preferenti independ, that requir all tradeoff between attribut to be independ. 230 unpric outcom is trivial, henc we consid choic among  attribut point with price. sinc ani outcom can be best given enough monetari compens, thi problem is not well-defin unless the combin ar constrain somehow. a particularli interest optim problem aris in the  context of negoti, where we consid the util of both buyer and seller. the multiattribut match problem (mmp) [12] is  concern with find an attribut point that maxim the surplu of a trade, or the differ between the util of the buyer and the seller, ub(a) − us(a). gai, as an addit decomposit, ha the properti that if ub and us ar in gai form then ub(a)−us(a) is in gai form as well. we can therefor us combinatori optim procedur for gai decomposit, base on the well studi  variabl elimin scheme (e.g., [15]) to find the best trade point. similarli, thi optim can be done to maxim surplu  between a trader"s util function and a price system that assign a price to each level of each gai element, and thi wai guid trader to their optim bid point. in the rest of the paper we develop a multiattribut procur auction that build on thi idea. 5. gai in multiattribut auction 5.1 the multiattribut procur problem in the procur set a singl buyer wish to procur a singl good, in some configur θ ∈ Θ from on of the  candid seller s1, . . . , sn. the buyer ha some privat valuat function (wtp) ub : Θ → r, and similarli each seller si ha a privat valuat function (willing-to-accept). for complianc with the procur literatur we refer to seller si"s valuat as a cost function, denot by ci. the multiattribut alloc problem (map) [19] is the welfar optim problem in procur over a discret domain, and it is defin as: i∗ , θ∗ = arg max i,θ (ub(θ) − ci(θ)). (5) to illustr the need for a gai price space we consid the case of trader with non-addit prefer bid in an addit price space such as in pk"s auction ad. if the buyer"s prefer ar not addit, choos prefer level per attribut (as in auction ad) admit undesir combin and fail to guid the seller to the effici configur. non-addit seller face an exposur problem, somewhat analog to trader with complementari  prefer that particip in simultan auction. a valu a1 for attribut a mai be optim given that the valu of anoth attribut b is b1 , and arbitrarili suboptim given other valu of b.  therefor bid a1 and b1 mai result in a poor alloc if the seller is outbid on b1 but left hold a1 .4 instead of assum full addit, the auction design can come up with a gai prefer structur that captur the set of common interdepend between attribut. if trader could bid on  cluster of interdepend attribut, it would solv the problem  discuss abov. for exampl, if a and b ar interdepend (mean cdi(a, b) doe not hold), we should be abl to bid on the cluster ab. if b in turn depend on c, we need anoth cluster bc. thi is still better than a gener price structur that solicit bid for the cluster abc. we stress that each trader mai have a differ set of interdepend, and therefor to be complet gener the 4 if onli the seller ar non-addit, the auction design could  potenti allevi thi problem by collect a new set of bid each round and forget bid from previou round, and also guid non-addit seller to bid on onli on level per attribut in order to avoid undesir combin. ya yb    yc z z z (i)   ¨ ©a, b   ¨ ©b, c (ii) figur 1: (i) cdi map for {a, b, c}, reflect the singl  condit cdi(a, c). (ii) the correspond gai network. gai structur need to account for all.5 howev, in practic mani domain have natur depend that ar mutual to trader. 5.2 gai tree assum that prefer of all trader ar reflect in a gai structur i1, . . . , ig. we call each ir a gai element, and ani  assign to ir a sub-configur. we us θr to denot the  subconfigur form by project configur θ to element ir. definit 9. let α be an assign to ir and β an  assign to ir . the sub-configur α and β ar consist if for ani attribut aj ∈ ir ∩ ir , α and β agre on the valu of aj. a collect ν of sub-configur is consist if all pair α, β ∈ ν ar consist. the collect is call a cover if it contain  exactli on sub-configur αr correspond to each element ir, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}. note that a consist cover {α1, . . . , αg} repres a full  configur, which we denot by (α1, . . . , αg). a gai network is a graph g whose node correspond to the gai element i1, . . . , ig, with an edg between ir, ir iff ir ∩ ir = ∅. equival, a gai network is the cliqu graph of a cdi-map. in order to justifi the compact price structur we requir that for ani set of optim configur (wrt a given util function), with a correspond collect of sub-configur γ, all  consist cover in γ must be optim configur as well. to ensur thi (see lemma 8 and 10), we assum a gai decomposit in the form of a tree or a forest (the gai tree). a tree structur can be achiev for ani set of cdi condit by triangul of the cdi-map prior to construct of the cliqu graph (gai network and gai tree ar defin by gonzal and perni [14], who also provid a triangul algorithm). under gai, the buyer"s valu function ub and seller" cost function ci can be decompos as in (1). we us fb,r and fi,r to denot the local function of buyer and seller (respect), accord to (4). for exampl, consid the procur of a good with three attribut, a, b, c. each attribut"s domain ha two valu (e.g., {a1 , a2 } is the domain of a). let the gai structur be i1 = {a, b}, i2 = {b, c}. figur 1 show the simpl cdi map and the correspond gai network, which is a gai tree. here,  subconfigur ar assign of the form a1 b1 , a1 b2 , b1 c1 , and so on. the set of sub-configur {a1 b1 , b1 c1 } is a consist cover, correspond to the configur a1 b1 c1 . in contrast, the set {a1 b1 , b2 c1 } is inconsist. 5.3 the gai auction we defin an iter multiattribut auction that maintain a gai price structur: that is, a price pt (·) correspond to each  subconfigur of each gai-tree element. the price of a  configur θ at time t is defin as pt (θ) = g x r=1 pt (θr) − Δ. 5 we relax thi requir in section 6. 231 bidder submit sub-bid on sub-configur and on an  addit global discount term Δ.6 sub-bid ar alwai submit for current price, and need to be resubmit at each round, therefor thei do not need to explicitli carri the price. the set of full bid of a seller contain all consist cover that can be gener from that seller"s current set of sub-bid. the exist of a full bid over a configur θ repres the seller"s willing to accept the price pt (θ) for suppli θ. at the start of the auction, the buyer report (to the auction, not to seller) her complet valuat in gai form. the initi price of sub-configur ar set at some level abov the buyer"s  valuat, that is, p1 (θr) > fb,r(θr) for all θr. the discount Δ is initi to zero. the auction ha the dynam of a descend clock auction: at each round t, bid ar collect for current price and then price ar reduc accord to price rule. a seller is consid activ in a round if she submit at least on full bid. in round t > 1, onli seller who where activ in round t − 1 ar  allow to particip, and the auction termin when no more than a singl seller is activ. we denot the set of sub-bid submit by si by bt i , and the correspond set of full bid is bt i = {θ = (θ1, . . . , θg) ∈ Θ | ∀r.θr ∈ bt i }. in our exampl, a seller could submit sub-bid on a set of  subconfigur such as a1 b1 and b1 c1 , and that combin to a full bid on a1 b1 c1 . the auction proce in two phase. in the first phase (a), at each round t the auction comput a set of prefer  sub-configur mt . section 5.4 show how to defin mt to ensur  converg, and section 5.5 show how to effici comput it. in phase a, the auction adjust price after each round, reduc the price of everi sub-configur that ha receiv a bid but is not in the prefer set. let be the prespecifi price increment paramet. specif, the phase a price chang rule is appli to all θr ∈ sn i=1 bt i \ mt : pt+1 (θr) ← max(pt (θr) − g , fb,r(θr)). [a] the rh maximum ensur that price do not get reduc below the buyer"s valuat in phase a. let mt denot the set of configur that ar consist cover in mt : mt = {θ = (θ1, . . . , θg) ∈ Θ | ∀r.θr ∈ mt } the auction switch to phase b when all activ seller have at least on full bid in the buyer"s prefer set: ∀i. bt i = ∅ ∨ bt i ∩ mt = ∅. [switch] let t be the round at which [switch] becom true. at thi point, the auction select the buyer-optim full bid ηi for each seller si. ηi = arg max θ∈bt i (ub(θ) − pt (θ)). (6) in phase b, si mai bid onli on ηi. the price of sub-configur ar fix at pt (·) dure thi phase. the onli adjust in phase b is to Δ, which is increas in everi round by . the auction  termin when at most on seller (if exactli on, design it sˆi) is activ. there ar four distinct case: 1. all seller drop out in phase a (i.e., befor rule [switch] hold). the auction return with no alloc. 6 the discount term could be replac with a uniform price  reduct across all sub-configur. 2. all activ seller drop out in the same round in phase b. the auction select the best seller (sˆi) from the preced round, and appli the applic case below. 3. the auction termin in phase b with a final price abov buyer"s valuat, pt (ηˆi) − Δ > ub(ηˆi). the auction offer the winner sˆi an opportun to suppli ηˆi at price ub(ηˆi). 4. the auction termin in phase b with a final price pt (ηˆi)− Δ ≤ ub(ηˆi). thi is the ideal situat, where the auction alloc the chosen configur and seller at thi result price. the overal auction is describ by high-level pseudocod in  algorithm 1. as explain in section 5.4, the role of phase a is to guid the trader to their effici configur. phase b is a on-dimension competit over the surplu that remain seller candid can provid to the buyer. in section 5.5 we discuss the comput task associ with the auction, and section 5.6 provid a detail exampl. algorithm 1 gai-base multiattribut auction collect a report valuat, ˆv from the buyer set high initi price, p1 (θr) on each level θr, and set Δ = 0 while not [switch] do collect sub-bid from seller comput mt appli price chang by [a] end while comput ηi while more than on activ seller do increas Δ by collect bid on (ηi, Δ) from seller end while implement alloc and payment to win seller 5.4 econom analysi when the optim solut to map (5) provid neg  welfar and seller do not bid below their cost, the auction  termin in phase a, no trade occur and the auction is trivial  effici. we therefor assum throughout the analysi that the optim (seller,configur) pair provid non-neg welfar. the buyer profit from a configur θ is defin as7 πb(θ) = ub(θ) − p(θ) and similarli πi(θ) = p(θ) − ci(θ) is the profit of si. in  addit, for μ ⊆ {1, . . . , g} we denot the correspond set of  subconfigur by θμ, and defin the profit from a configur θ over the subset μ as πb(θμ) = x r∈μ (fb,r(θr) − p(θr)). πi(θμ) is defin similarli for si. crucial, for ani μ and it  complement ¯μ and for ani trader τ, πτ (θ) = πτ (θμ) + πτ (θ¯μ). the function σi : Θ → r repres the welfar, or surplu  function ub(·) − ci(·). for ani price system p, σi(θ) = πb(θ) + πi(θ). 7 we drop the t superscript in gener statement involv price and profit function, understand that all usag is with respect to the (current) applic price. 232 sinc we do not assum anyth about the buyer"s strategi, the analysi refer to profit and surplu with respect to the face valu of the buyer"s report. the function πi and σi refer to the true cost function of si. definit 10. a seller is call straightforward bidder (sb) if at each round t she bid on bt i as follow: if maxθ∈Θ πt i (θ) < 0, then bt i = ∅. otherwis let Ωt i ⊆ arg max θ∈Θ πt i (θ) bt i = {θr | θ ∈ Ωt i, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}}. intuit, an sb seller follow a myopic best respons strategi (mbr), mean thei bid myopic rather than strateg by optim their profit with respect to current price. to  calcul bt i seller need to optim their current profit function, as  discuss in section 4.2. the follow lemma bridg the appar gap between the  compact price and bid structur and the global optim perform by the trader. lemma 8. let Ψ be a set of configur, all maxim profit for a trader τ (seller or buyer) at the relev price. let Φ = {θr | θ ∈ Ψ, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}. then ani consist cover in Φ is also a profit-maxim configur for τ. proof sketch (full proof in the onlin appendix): a sourc of an  element θr is a configur ˜θ ∈ Ψ from which it origin  (mean, ˜θr = θr). start from the supposedli suboptim cover θ1 , we build a seri of cover θ1 , . . . , θl . at each θj we flip the valu of a set of sub-configur μj correspond to a subtre, with the sub-configur of the configur ˆθj ∈ Ψ which is the sourc of the parent γj of μj . that ensur that all element in μj ∪ {γj} have a mutual sourc ˆθj . we show that all θj ar  consist and that thei must all be suboptim as well, and sinc all element of θl have a mutual sourc, mean θl = ˆθl ∈ Ψ, it contradict optim of Ψ. corollari 9. for sb seller si, ∀t, ∀θ ∈ bt i , πt i (θ ) = max θ∈Θ πt i (θ). next we consid combin of configur that ar onli within some δ of optim. lemma 10. let Ψ be a set of configur, all ar within δ of maxim profit for a trader τ at the price, and Φ defin as in lemma 8. then ani consist cover in Φ is within δg of maxim util for τ. thi bound is tight, that is for ani gai tree and a non-trivial domain we can construct a set Ψ as abov in which there exist a consist cover whose util is exactli δg below the maxim. next we formal defin mt . for connect gai tree, mt is the set of sub-configur that ar part of a configur within of optim. when the gai tree is in fact a forest, we apport the error proportion across the disconnect tree. let g be compris of tree g1, . . . , gh. we us θj to denot the project of a configur θ on the tree gj , and gj denot the number of gai element in gj . mt j = {θr | πt b(θj) ≥ max θj ∈Θj πt b(θj ) − gj g , r ∈ gj } then defin mt = sh j=1 mt j. let ej = gj −1 denot the number of edg in gj . we defin the connect paramet, e = maxj=1,...,h ej . as shown below, thi connect paramet is an import factor in the perform of the auction. corollari 11. ∀θ ∈ mt , πt b(θ ) ≥ max θ∈Θ πt b(θ) − (e + 1) in the fulli addit case thi loss of effici reduc to . on the other extrem, if the gai network is connect then e+1 = g. we also note that without assum ani prefer structur, mean that the cdi map is fulli connect, g = 1 and the effici loss is again . lemma 12 through 15 show that through the price system, the choic of buyer prefer configur, and price chang rule, phase a lead the buyer and each of the seller to their mutual effici configur. lemma 12. maxθ∈Θ πt b(θ) doe not chang in ani round t of phase a. proof. we prove the lemma per each tree gj. the optim valu for disconnect compon ar independ of each other henc if the maxim profit for each compon doe not chang the combin maxim profit doe not chang as well. if the price of θj wa reduc dure phase a, that is pt+1 (θj) = pt (θj ) − δ, it must be the case that some w ≤ gj sub-configur of θj ar not in mt j, and δ = w g . the definit of mt j ensur πt b(θj ) < max θ∈Θ πt b(θj) − gj g . therefor, πt+1 b (θ ) = πt (θ ) + δ = πt (θ ) + w g ≤ max θ∈Θ πt b(θj). thi is true for ani configur whose profit improv,  therefor the maxim buyer profit doe not chang dure phase a. lemma 13. the price of at least on sub-configur must be reduc at everi round in phase a. proof. in each round t < t of phase a there exist an activ seller i for whom bt i ∩ mt = ∅. howev to be activ in round t, bt i = ∅. let ˆθ ∈ bt i . if ∀r.ˆθr ∈ mt , then ˆθ ∈ mt by definit of mt . therefor there must be ˆθr ∈ mt . we need to prove that for at least on of these sub-configur, πt b(ˆθr) < 0 to ensur activ of rule [a]. assum for contradict that for ani ˆθr ∈ ¯mt , πt b(ˆθr) ≥ 0. for simplic we assum that for ani θr, π1 b (θr) is some product of g (that can be easili done), and that ensur that πt b(ˆθr) = 0 becaus onc profit hit 0 it cannot increas by rule [a]. if ˆθr ∈ ¯mt , ∀r = 1, . . . , g then πt b(ˆθ) = 0. thi contradict lemma 12 sinc we set high initi price. therefor some of the sub-configur of ˆθ ar in mt , and wlog we assum it is ˆθ1, . . . , ˆθk. to be in mt these k sub-configur must have been in some prefer full configur, mean there exist θ ∈ mt such that θ = (ˆθ1, . . . , ˆθk, θk+1, . . . , θg) sinc ˆθ /∈ mt it must be that case that πt b(ˆθ) < πt b(θ ). therefor πt b(θk+1, . . . , θg) > πt b(ˆθk+1, . . . , ˆθg) = 0 henc for at least on r ∈ {k + 1, . . . , g}, πt b(θr) > 0  contradict rule [a]. 233 lemma 14. when the solut to map provid posit  surplu, and at least the best seller is sb, the auction must reach phase b. proof. by lemma 13 price must go down in everi round of phase a. rule [a] set a lower bound on all price therefor the auction either termin in phase a or must reach condit [switch]. we set the initi price ar high such that maxθ∈Θ π1 b (θ) < 0, and by lemma 12 maxθ∈Θ πt b(θ) < 0 dure phase a. we  assum that the effici alloc (θ∗ , i∗ ) provid posit welfar, that is σi∗ (θ∗ ) = πt b(θ∗ ) + πt i∗ (θ∗ ) > 0. si∗ is sb therefor she will leav the auction onli when πt i∗ (θ∗ ) < 0. thi can happen onli when πt b(θ∗ ) > 0, therefor si∗ doe not drop in phase a henc the auction cannot termin befor reach  condit [switch]. lemma 15. for sb seller si, ηi is (e + 1) -effici. proof. ηi is chosen to maxim the buyer"s surplu out of bt i at the end of phase a. sinc bt i ∩ mt = ∅, clearli ηi ∈ mt . from corollari 11 and corollari 9, for ani ˜θ, πt b (ηi) ≥ πt b (˜θ) − (e + 1) πt i (ηi) ≥ πt i (˜θ) ⇒ σi(ηi) ≥ σi(˜θ) − (e + 1) thi establish the approxim bilater effici of the result of phase a (at thi point under the assumpt of sb). base on phase b"s simpl role as a singl-dimension bid competit over the discount, we next assert that the overal result is effici under sb, which in turn prove to be an approxim ex-post equilibrium strategi in the two phase. lemma 16. if seller si and sj ar sb, and si is activ at least as long as sj is activ in phase b, then σi(ηi) ≥ max θ∈Θ σj(θ) − (e + 2) . theorem 17. given a truth buyer and sb seller, the  auction is (e+2) -effici: the surplu of the final alloc is within (e + 2) of the maxim surplu. follow pk, we reli on an equival to the on-side vcg auction to establish incent properti for the seller. in the  onesid multiattribut vcg auction, buyer and seller report  valuat and cost function ˆub, ˆci, and the buyer pai the sell-side vcg payment to the win seller. definit 11. let (θ∗ , i∗ ) be the optim solut to map. let (˜θ,˜i) be the best solut to map when i∗ doe not particip. the sell-side vcg payment is v cg(ˆub, ˆci) = ˆub(θ∗ ) − (ˆub(˜θ) − ˆc˜i(˜θ)). it is well-known that truth bid is a domin strategi for seller in the on-side vcg auction. it is also shown by pk that the maxim regret for buyer from bid truthfulli in thi  mechan is ub(θ∗ ) − ci∗ (θ∗ ) − (ub(˜θ) − ˆc˜i(˜θ)), that is, the margin product of the effici seller. usual in iter auction the vcg outcom is onli nearli achiev, but the deviat is bound by the minim price chang. we show a similar result, and therefor defin δ-vcg payment. definit 12. sell-side δ-vcg payment for map is a  payment p such that v cg(ˆub, ˆci) − δ ≤ p ≤ v cg(ˆub, ˆci) + δ. when payment is guarante to be δ-vcg seller can onli affect their payment within that rang, therefor their gain by fals  report their cost is bound by 2δ. lemma 18. when seller ar sb, the payment in the end of gai auction is sell-side (e + 2) -vcg. theorem 19. sb is an (3e + 5) ex-post nash equilibrium for seller in gai auction. that is, seller cannot gain more than (3e + 5) by deviat. in practic, howev, seller ar unlik to have the inform that would let them exploit that potenti gain. thei ar much more like to lose from bid on their less attract configur. 5.5 comput and complex the size of the price space maintain in the auction is equal to the total number of sub-configur, mean it is exponenti in maxr |ir|. thi is also equival to the tree-width (plu on) of the origin cdi-map. for the purpos of the comput analysi let dj denot the domain of attribut aj, and i = sg r=1 q j∈ir dj, the collect of all sub-configur. the first purpos of thi sub-section is to show that the complex of all the comput requir for the auction depend onli on |i|, i.e., no comput depend on the size of the full exponenti domain. we ar first concern with the comput of mt . sinc mt grow monoton with t, a naiv applic of optim algorithm to gener the best outcom sequenti might end up enumer signific portion of the fulli exponenti domain. howev as shown below thi plain enumer can be avoid. proposit 20. the comput of mt can be done in time o(|i|2 ). moreov, the total time spent on thi task throughout the auction is o(|i|(|i| + t)). the bound ar in practic significantli lower, base on result on similar problem from the probabilist reason literatur [18]. on of the benefit of the compact price structur is the  compact represent it lend for bid: seller submit onli sub-bid, and therefor the number of them submit and store per seller is bound by |i|. sinc the comput task: bt i = ∅, rule [switch] and choic of ηi ar all involv the set bt i , it is  import to note that their perform onli depend on the size of the set bt i , sinc thei ar all subsum by the combinatori  optim task over bt i or bt i ∩ mt . next, we analyz the number of round it take for the auction to termin. phase b requir maxi=1,...n πt i (ηi)1 . sinc thi is equival to price-onli auction, the concern is onli with the time complex of phase a. sinc price cannot go below fb,r(θr), an upper bound on the number of round requir is t ≤ x θr∈i (p1 (θr) − fb,r(θr)) g howev phase a mai converg faster. let the initi neg profit chosen by the auction be m = maxθ∈Θ π1 b (θ). in the worst case phase a need to run until ∀θ ∈ Θ.πb(θ) = m. thi happen for exampl when ∀θr ∈ i.pt (θr) = fb,r(θr) + m g . in gener, the closer the initi price reflect buyer valuat, the faster phase a converg. on extrem is to choos p1 (θr) = 234 i1 i2 a1 b1 a2 b1 a1 b2 a2 b2 b1 c1 b2 c1 b1 c2 b2 c2 fb 65 50 55 70 50 85 60 75 f1 35 20 30 70 65 65 70 61 f2 35 20 25 25 55 110 70 95 tabl 1: gai util function for the exampl domain. fb  repres the buyer"s valuat, and f1 and f2 cost of the seller s1 and s2. fb,r(θr) + m g . that would make phase a redund, at the cost of full initi revel of buyer"s valuat as done in other  mechan discuss below. between thi option and the other extrem, which is ∀α, ˆα ∈ i, p1 (α) = p1 (ˆα) the auction ha a rang of choic to determin the right tradeoff between converg time and inform revel. in the exampl below the choic of a lower initi price for the domain of i1 provid some speedup by reveal a harmless amount of inform. anoth potenti concern is the commun cost associ with the japanes auction style. the seller need to send their bid over and over again at each round. a simpl chang can be made to avoid much of the redund commun: the auction can retain sub-bid from previou round on sub-configur whose price did not chang. sinc combin of sub-bid from differ round can yield sub-optim configur, each sub-bid should be tag with the number of the latest round in which it wa  submit, and onli consist combin from the same round ar consid to be full bid. with thi implement seller need not resubmit their bid until a price of at least on sub-configur ha chang. 5.6 exampl we us the exampl set introduc in section 5.2. recal that the gai structur is i1 = {a, b}, i2 = {b, c} (note that e = 1). tabl 1 show the gai util for the buyer and the two seller s1, s2. the effici alloc is (s1, a1 b2 c1 ) with a surplu of 45. the maxim surplu of the second best seller, s2, is 25, achiev by a1 b1 c1 , a2 b1 c1 , and a2 b2 c2 . we set all initi price over i1 to 75, and all initi price over i2 to 90. we set = 8, mean that price reduct for sub-configur is 4. though with these number it is not guarante by theorem 17, we expect s1 to win on either the effici alloc or on a1 b2 c2 which provid a surplu of 39. the reason is that these ar the onli two configur which ar within (e + 1) = 16 of be effici for s1 (therefor on of them must be chosen by phase a), and both provid more than surplu over s2"s most effici configur (and thi is suffici in order to win in phase b). tabl 2 show the progress of phase a. initi all configur have the same cost (165), so seller bid on their lowest cost  configur which is a2 b1 c1 for both (with profit 80 to s1 and 90 to s2), and that translat to sub-bid on a2 b1 and b1 c1 . m1 contain the sub-configur a2 b2 and b2 c1 of the highest valu configur a2 b2 c1 . price is therefor decreas on a2 b1 and b1 c1 . after the price chang, s1 ha higher profit (74) on a1 b2 c2 and she therefor bid on a1 b2 and b2 c2 . now (round 2) their price go down,  reduc the profit on a1 b2 c2 to 66 and therefor in round 3 s1 prefer a2 b1 c2 (profit 67). after the next price chang the configur a1 b2 c1 and a1 b2 c2 both becom optim (profit 66), and the  subbid a1 b2 , b2 c1 and b2 c2 captur the two. these configur stai optim for anoth round (5), with profit 62. at thi point s1 ha a full bid (in fact two full bid: a1 b2 c2 and a1 b2 c1 ) in m5 , and i1 i2 t a1b1 a2b1 a1b2 a2b2 b1c1 b2c1 b1c2 b2c2 1 75 75 75 75 90 90

of her  optim configur doe not decreas. s2 stick to a2 b1 c1 dure the first four round, switch to a1 b1 c1 in round 5. it take four more round for s2 and mt to converg (m10 ∩b10 2 = {a1 b1 c1 }). after round 9 the auction set η1 = a1 b2 c1 (which yield more buyer profit than a1 b2 c2 ) and η2 = a1 b1 c1 . for the next round (10) Δ = 8, increas by 8 for each subsequ round. note that p9 (a1 b1 c1 ) = 133, and c2(a1 b1 c1 ) = 90, therefor πt 2 (η2) = 43. in round 15, Δ = 48 mean p15 (a1 b1 c1 ) = 85 and that caus s2 to drop out, set the final alloc to (s1, a1 b2 c1 ) and p15 (a1 b2 c1 ) = 157 − 48 = 109. that leav the buyer with a profit of 31 and s1 with a profit of 14, less than below the vcg profit 20. the welfar achiev in thi case is optim. to illustr how some effici loss could occur consid the case that c1(b2 c2 ) = 60. in that case, in round 3 the configur a1 b2 c2 provid the same profit (67) as a2 b1 c2 , and s1 bid on both. while a2 b1 c2 is no longer optim after the price chang, a1 b2 c2 remain optim on subsequ round becaus b2 c2 ∈ mt , and the price chang of a1 b2 affect both a1 b2 c2 and the effici configur a1 b2 c1 . when phase a end b10 1 ∩ m10 = {a1 b2 c2 } so the auction  termin with the slightli suboptim configur and surplu 40. 6. discuss 6.1 preferenti assumpt a kei aspect in implement gai base auction is the choic of the prefer structur, that is, the element {i1, . . . , ig}. in some domain the structur can be more or less robust over time and over differ decis maker. when thi is not the case,  extract reliabl structur from seller (in the form of cdi  condit) is a seriou challeng. thi could have been a deal breaker for such domain, but in fact it can be overcom. it turn out that we can run thi auction without ani assumpt on seller"  prefer structur. the onli place where thi assumpt is us in our analysi is for lemma 8. if seller whose prefer structur doe not agre with the on us by the auction ar guid to submit onli on full bid at each round, or a set of bid that doe not yield undesir consist combin, all the properti of the auction 235 still hold. local, the seller can optim their profit function us the union of their gai structur with the auction"s structur. it is therefor essenti onli that the buyer"s prefer structur is accur model. of cours, captur seller" structur as well is still prefer sinc it can speed up the execut and let seller take advantag of the compact bid represent. in both case the choic of cluster mai significantli affect the complex of the price structur and the runtim of the auction. it is sometim better to ignor some weaker interdepend in order to reduc dimension. the complex of the structur also affect the effici of the auction through the valu of e. 6.2 inform revel properti in consid inform properti of thi mechan we  compar to the standard approach for iter multiattribut auction, which is base on the theoret foundat of che [7]. in most of these mechan the buyer reveal a score function and then the mechan solicit bid from the seller [3, 22, 8, 21] (the  mechan suggest by beil and wein [2] is differ sinc buyer can modifi their score function each round, but the goal there is to maxim the buyer"s profit). wherea these iter  procur mechan tend to reliev the burden of inform  revel from the seller, a major drawback is that the buyer"s  util function must be reveal to the seller befor receiv ani commit. in the mechan suggest by pk and in our gai auction abov, buyer inform is reveal onli in exchang for sell commit. in particular, seller learn noth (beyond the initi price upper bound, which can be arbitrarili loos) about the util of configur for which no bid wa submit. when bid ar submit for a configur θ, seller would be abl to infer it util rel to the current prefer configur onli after the price of θ is driven down suffici to make it a prefer configur as well. 6.3 conclus we propos a novel exploit of prefer structur in  multiattribut auction. rather than assum full addit, or no  structur at all, we model prefer us the gai decomposit. we develop an iter auction mechan directli reli on the decomposit, and also provid direct mean of construct the represent from rel simpl statement of  willingnessto-pai. our auction mechan gener pk"s prefer  model, while in essenc retain their inform revel  properti. it allow for a rang of tradeoff between accuraci of  prefer represent and both the complex of the price structur and effici of the auction, as well as tradeoff between buyer"s inform revel and the time requir for converg. 7. acknowledg thi work wa
