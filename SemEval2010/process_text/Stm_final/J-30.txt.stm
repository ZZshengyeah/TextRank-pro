their type - and choos action from their action space to  maxim their util. the social planner wish to implement a social-choic function, which map each possibl state of the world (i.e., a profil of the player" type) to a singl altern. for exampl, a govern that wish to  undertak a public-good project (e.g., build a bridg) onli if the total benefit for the player exce it cost. much of the literatur on mechan design restrict  attent to direct revel mechan, in which a player"s action space is ident to hi type space. thi focu is ow to the revel principl that assert that if some mechan achiev a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achiev in a truth on - an  equilibrium where each agent simpli report hi privat type [15]. nonetheless, in mani environ, direct-revel mechan ar not viabl sinc the action avail for the player have a limit express power. consid, for  exampl, the well-studi screen model, where an  insur firm wish to sell differ type of polici to differ driver base on their caution level, which is their privat inform. in thi model, driver mai have a continuum of possibl caution level, but insur compani offer onli a few differ polici sinc it might be either infeas or illeg to advertis and sell more then few type of polici. there ar variou reason for such strict restrict on the action space. in some situat, firm ar not will, or cannot, run a bid process but prefer fix a price for some product or servic. the buyer in such environemnt face onli two action - to bui or not to bui - although thei mai have an infinit number of possibl valu for the item. in mani similar set, player might be also reluct to reveal their accur type, but will to disclos partial  inform about them. for exampl, agent will typic be unwil to reveal their type, even if it is benefici for them in the short run, sinc it might harm them in futur  transact. agent mai also not trust the mechan to keep their valuat privat [16], or not even know their exact type while comput it mai be expens [12]. limit on the action space can also be caus by technic  constraint, such as sever restrict on the commun line [5] or from the the need to perform quick transact (e.g., discret bid in english auction [9]). 62 consid for exampl a public-good model: a social  planner need to decid whether to build a bridg. the two player in the game have some privat known benefit θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from us thi bridg. the social planner aim to build the bridg onli if the sum of these benfit  exce the construct cost of the bridg. the social planner cannot access the privat data of the player, and can onli learn about it from the player" action. when direct  revel is allow, the social planner can run the well-known vcg mechan, where the player have incent to  report their true data; henc, the planner can elicit the exact privat inform of the player and build the bridg onli when it should be built. assum now that the player  cannot send their entir secret data, but can onli choos an action out of two possibl action (e.g., 0 or 1). now, the social planner will clearli no longer be abl to alwai build the bridg accord to her object function, due to the limit expressiv of the player" messag. in thi work we try to analyz what can be achiev in the presenc of such restrict. restrict on the action space, for specif model, were studi in sever earlier paper. the work of blumrosen, nisan and segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to thi paper. thei studi singl-item auction where bidder ar allow to send messag with sever bound size. thei  character the optim mechan under thi restrict, and show that nearli optim result can be achiev even with veri strict limit on the action space. other work  studi similar model for the analysi of discret-bid ascend auction [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leav-it auction [17], or for measur the effect of discret prioriti class of buyer on the perform of electr market [19, 14]. our work gener the main result of blumrosen et al. to a  gener mechan-design framework that can be appli to a multitud of model. we show that some main properti prove by blumrosen et al. ar preserv in more gener framework (for exampl, that domin-strategi  equilibrium can be achiev with no addit cost, and that the loss diminish with the number of possibl action in a  similar rate), where some other properti do not alwai hold (for exampl, that asymmetr mechan ar optim and that player must alwai us all their action space). a standard mechan design set is compos of agent with privat inform (their type), and a  social planner, who wish to implement a social choic  function, c - a function that map ani profil of the agent" type into a chosen altern. a classic result in thi  set sai that under some monoton assumpt on the agent" prefer - the singl-cross assumpt (see definit below) - a social-choic function is implement in domin strategi if and onli if it is monoton in the player" type. howev, in environ with restrict  action space, the social planner cannot typic implement everi social-choic function due to inher inform constraint. that is, for some realiz of the player" type, the decis of the social planner will be incompat with the social-choic function c. in order to quantit measur how well bound-action mechan can  approxim the origin social-choic function, we follow a  standard assumpt that the social choic function is deriv from a social-valu function, g, which assign a real valu for everi altern a and realiz of the player" type. the social-choic function c will therefor choos an  altern that maxim the social valu function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxa{g( −→ θ , a)}. observ that the social-valu function is not necessarili the social welfar function - the social welfar function is a  special case of g in which g is defin to be the sum of the player" valuat for the chosen altern. follow ar sever simpl exampl of social-valu function: • public good. a govern wish to build a bridg onli if the sum of the benefit that agent gain from it exce it construct cost c. the social valu function in a 2-player game will therefor be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-c and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • rout in network. consid a network that is  compos of two link in parallel. each link ha a secret probabl pi of transfer a messag successfulli. a sender wish to send hi messag through the  network onli if the probabl of success is greater than, sai, 90 percent - the known probabl in an altern network. that is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in altern network)=0.9. • singl-item auction. consid a 2-player auction, where the auction wish to alloc the item to the player who valu it the most. the social choic  function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 win) = θ1 and for the second altern is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 win) = θ2. 1.1 our contribut in thi paper, we present a gener framework for the studi of mechan design in environ with a limit number of action. we assum a bayesian model where player have on-dimension privat type, independ distribut on some real interv. the main question we ask is: when agent ar onli allow to us k differ action, which mechan achiev the  optim expect social-valu? note that thi question is  actual compos of two separ question. the first question is an inform-theoret question: what is the optim result achiev when the player can onli reveal  inform us these k action (recal that their type space mai be continu). the other question involv  gametheoret consider: what is the best result achiev with k action, where thi result should be achiev in a domin-strategi equilibrium. these question rais the question about the price of implement: can the  optim inform-theoret result alwai be implement in a domin-strategi equilibrium? and if not, to what  extent doe the domin-strategi requir degrad the optim result? what we call the price of implement wa also explor in other context in game theori where comput restrict appli: for exampl, is it alwai true that the optim polynomi-time approxim ratio (for exampl, in combinatori auction) can be achiev in equilibrium? (the answer for thi interest problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].) our first contribut is the character of suffici condit for implement the optim  informationtheoret social-choic rule in domin strategi. we show that for the famili of multilinear social-valu function (that 63 is, polynomi where each variabl ha a degre of at most on in each monomi) the domin-strategi  implement incur no addit cost. theorem: given ani multilinear singl-cross  socialvalu function, and for ani number of altern and  player, the social choic rule that is inform-theoret optim is implement in domin strategi. multilinear social-valu function captur mani  import and well-studi model, and includ, for instanc, the rout exampl given abov, and ani social welfar  function in which the player" valuat ar linear in their type (such as public-good and auction). the implement of the inform-theoret  optim mechan enabl us to us a standard routin in mechan design and first determin the optim  socialchoic rule, and then calcul the appropri payment that ensur incent compat. to show thi result, we prove a us lemma that give anoth character for social-choic function whose price of implement is zero. we show that for ani social-choic function, incent compat in action-bound mechan is equival to the properti that the optim expect social valu is achiev with non-decreas strategi (or threshold  strategi).1 in other word, thi lemma impli that on can alwai implement, with domin strategi, the best  socialchoic rule that is achiev with non-decreas strategi. our second contribut is in character the optim action-bound mechan. we identifi some necessari condit for the optim of mechan in gener, and us these condit, we fulli character the optim mechan in environ with two player and two  altern. the optim mechan turn out to be diagon - that is, in their matrix represent, on altern will be chosen in, and onli in, entri below on of the main  diagon (thi term extend the concept of prioriti game us in [5] for bound-commun auction). we  complet the character of the optim mechan with the depict of the optim strategi - strategi that ar mutual maxim. sinc the payment in a  dominantstrategi implement ar uniqu defin by a monoton alloc and a profil of strategi, thi also defin the payment in the mechan. we give an intuit proof for the optim of such strategi, gener the concept of optim mutual-center strategi from [4].  surprisingli, as oppos to the optim auction in [4], for some non-trivial social-valu function, the optim diagon mechan mai not util all the k avail action. theorem: for ani multilinear singl-cross social-valu function over two altern, the information optim 2-player k-action mechan is diagon, and the optim domin strategi ar mutual-maxim. achiev a full character of the optim  actionbound mechan for multi-player or multi-altern environ seem to be harder. to support thi claim, we observ that the number of mechan that satisfi the necessari condit abov is grow exponenti in the number of player. 1 the restrict to non-decreas strategi is veri  common in the literatur. on remark result by athei [1] show that when a non-decreas strategi is a best respons for ani other profil of non-decreas strategi, a pure bayesian-nash equilibrium must exist. our next result compar the expect social-valu in k-action mechan to the optim expect social valu when the action space is unrestrict. for ani number of player or altern, and for ani profil of independ distribut function, we construct mechan that ar nearli optim - up to an addit differ of o( 1 k2 ). thi result is achiev in domin strategi. theorem: for ani multilinear social-valu function, the optim k-action mechan incur an expect social loss of o( 1 k2 ). thi is the same asymptot rate prove for specif  environ in [19, 9, 5]. note that there ar social-choic function that can be implement with k action with no loss at all (for exampl, the rule alwai choos altern a). howev, we know that in some set (e.g.,  auction [5]) the optim loss mai be proport to 1 k2 , thu a better gener upper bound is imposs. final, we present our result in the context of sever natur applic. first, we give an explicit solut for a public-good game with k-action. we show that the  optimum is achiev in symmetr mechan (in contrast to action-bound auction [5]), and that the optim  alloc scheme depend on the valu of the construct cost c. then, we studi the celebr signal model, in which potenti employe send signal about their skill to  potenti employ by mean of the educ level thei acquir. thi is a natur applic in our context sinc educ level ar often discret (e.g., b.a, m.a and phd). lastli, we present our result in the context of rout in network, where it is reason to assum that link report whether thei have low or high loss rate, but less reason to  requir them to report their accur loss rate. the latter exampl illustr how our result appli to set where the goal of the social planner is not welfar maxim (nor variant of it like affin maxim). the rest of the paper is organ as follow: our model and notat ar describ in section 2. we then describ our gener result regard implement in multi-player and multi-altern environ in section 3, includ the asymptot analysi of the social-valu loss. in  section 4, we fulli character the optim mechan for  2player environ with two altern. in section 5, we conclud with appli our gener result to sever  wellstudi model. due to lack of space, some of the proof ar miss and can be found in the full version that can be found on the author" web page. 2. model and preliminari we first describ a standard mechan-design model for player with on-dimension type. then, in subsect 2.2, we impos limit on the action space. the  gener model studi environ with n player and a set a = {a1, a2, ..., am} of m altern. each player ha a privat known type θi ∈ [θi, θi] (where θi, θi ∈ r, θi < θi), and a type-depend valuat function vi(θi, a) for each altern a ∈ a. in other word, player i with type θi is will to pai an amount of vi(θi, a) for altern a to be chosen. each type θi is independ distribut accord to a publicli known distribut fi, with an alwai posit densiti function fi. we denot the set of all possibl type profil by Θ = ×n i=1[θi, θi]. 64 the social planner ha a social-choic function c : Θ → a, where the choic of altern is made in order to maxim a social-valu function g( −→ θ ) : Θ × a → r. that is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxa∈a{g( −→ θ , a)} we assum that for everi altern a ∈ a, the function g(·, a) is continu and differenti in everi type. sinc the player" type ar privat inform, in order to choos the optim altern, the social planner need to get the player" type as an input. the player reveal inform about their type by choos an action, from an action set b. each player us a strategi for determin the action he plai for ani possibl type. a strategi for player i is  therefor a function si : [θi, θi] −→ b. we denot a profil of strategi by s = s1, ..., sn and the set of the strategi of all player except i by s−i. the util of player i of type θi from altern a under the payment pi is ui = vi(θi, a) − pi. 2.1 domin-strategi implement follow is a standard definit of a mechan. the action space b is tradition implicit, but we mention it explicitli sinc we later examin limit on b. definit 1. a mechan with an action set b is a pair (t, p) where: • t : bn → a is the alloc rule.2 • p : bn → rn is the payment scheme (i.e., pi(b) is the payment to the ith player given a vector of action b). the main goal of thi paper is to optim the expect  social valu (in action-bound mechan) while preserv a domin-strategi equilibrium. we sai that a strategi si is domin for player i in  mechan (t, p) if player i cannot increas hi util by report a differ action than si(θi), regardless of the action of the other player b−i.3 definit 2. we sai that a social-choic function h is implement with a set of action b if there exist a  mechan (t, p) with a domin-strategi equilibrium s1, ..., sn (where for each i, si : [θi, θi] −→ b) that alwai choos an altern accord to h, i.e., t(s1(θ1), ..., sn(θn)) = h( −→ θ ). a fundament result in the mechan-design literatur state that under the singl-cross condit, the  monoton of the social-choic function is a suffici and  necessari condit for domin-strategi implement (in singl-paramet environ). the singl-cross  condit (also known as the spenc-mirrle condit)  appear, veri often implicitli, in almost everi paper on  mechan design in on-dimension domain. without thi  assumpt, gener suffici condit for implement ar unknown (for a survei on thi topic see [10]).  throughout thi paper, we assum that the valuat function of the player ar singl-cross, as defin below. a player"s valuat function will be singl-cross if the effect of an increment in the player"s type on the player"s valuat for 2 we will show that, w.l.o.g., we can focu on determinist alloc scheme. 3 that is, for everi type θi and everi action bi, we have that vi ( θi, t(si(θi), b−i) )-pi(si(θi), b−i)¿vi ( θi, t(bi, b−i)  )pi(bi, b−i) two altern is alwai greater for on of these  altern. the singl-cross condit on the player"  prefer actual defin an order on the altern. for exampl, if the valu of player i for altern a increas more rapidli than hi valu for altern b, we can denot it by a i b. later on, we will us these order for defin monoton of social-choic function. definit 3. a function h : Θ × a → r is singl  cross with respect to i if there is a weak order i on the altern, such that for ani two altern aj i al we have that for everi −→ θ ∈ Θ, ∂h( −→ θ , aj ) ∂θi > ∂h( −→ θ , al) ∂θi and if aj ∼ al (that is, al i aj and aj i al) then h(·, aj) ≡ h(·, al) (i.e., the function ar ident). the definit of monoton social-choic function also  requir an order on the action. thi order is implicit in most of the standard set where, for exampl, it is  defin by the order on the real number (e.g., in direct  revel mechan where each type is drawn from a real interv). when the action space is discret, the order can be determin by the name of the action, for exampl, 0, 1,...,k-1 for k-action mechan. (we therefor describ thi order with the standard relat on natur number <, >.) definit 4. a determinist mechan is monoton if when player i rais hi report action, and fix the action of the other player, the mechan never choos an inferior altern for i. that is, for ani b−i ∈ {0, ..., k− 1}n−1 if bi > bi then t(bi, b−i) i t(bi, b−i). follow is a classic result regard the implement of social-choic function in singl-paramet environ. note, howev, that thi character doe not hold when the action space is bound. proposit 1. assum that the valuat function vi(θi, a) ar singl cross and that the action space is  unrestrict. a social-choic function c is domin-strategi implement if and onli if c is monoton. 2.2 action-bound mechan the set of action b is usual implicit in the literatur, and it is assum to be isomorph to the type space. in thi paper, we studi environ where thi assumpt doe not hold. we defin a k-action game to be a game in which the number of possibl action for each player is k, i.e., |b| = k. in k-action game, the social planner typic cannot alwai choos an altern accord to the social choic function c due to the inform constraint. instead, we ar interest in implement a social-choic function that, with k action, maxim the expect social valu: e−→ θ g −→ θ , t (s1(θ1), ..., sn(θn))  . definit 5. we sai that a social-choic function h : Θ → a is information achiev with a set of action b if there exist a profil of strategi s1, ..., sn (where for each i, si : [θi, θi] −→ b), and an alloc rule t : bn → a, such that t choos the same altern as h for ani type profil, i.e., t(s1(θ1), ..., t(θn)) = h( −→ θ ). if |b| = k, we sai that h is k-action information achiev. 65 note that thi definit doe not take into account  strateg consider. for exampl, consid an environ with two altern a = {a, b}, and the follow  socialchoic function: ec(θ1, θ2) = a iff {θ1 > 1/2 and θ2 > 1/2}. ec is information achiev with two action: if both  player bid 0 when their valu is greater than 1/2 and 1 otherwis, then the alloc rule choos altern a iff both player report 1 deriv exactli the same alloc for everi profil of type. in contrast, it is easi to see that the function ˆc(θ1, θ2) = a iff θ1 + θ2 > 1/2 is not  information achiev with two action. we now defin a social-choic rule that maxim the social valu under the inform-theoret constraint that ar impli by the limit on the number of action. definit 6. a social-choic function is k-action  information optim with respect to the social-valu function g, if it achiev the maxim expect social valu among all the k-action information achiev social-choic  function.4 earlier in thi section, we defin the singl-cross  properti for the player valuat. we now defin a  singlecross properti on the social-valu function g. thi  properti clearli ensur the monoton of the correspond social choic rule, and we will later show that it is also us for action-bound environ. definit 7. we sai that the social-choic rule g( −→ θ , a) exhibit the singl-cross properti if for everi player i, g exhibit the singl-cross properti with respect to i. note that the definit abov requir that g will be  singl cross with respect to everi player i, given her  individu order i on the altern. that is, the social valu function g will be compat in thi sens with the  singlecross condit on the player" prefer. final, we call attent to a natur set of strategi - non-decreas strategi, where each player report a higher action as her type increas. equival, such strategi ar threshold strategi - strategi where each player divid hi type support into interv, and simpli report the interv in which her type li. definit 8. a real vector x = (x0, x1, ..., xk) is a  vector of threshold valu if x0 ≤ x1 ≤ ... ≤ xk. definit 9. a strategi si is a threshold strategi base on a vector of threshold valu x = (x0, x1, ..., xk), if for ani action j it hold that si(θi) = j iff θi ∈ [xj , xj+1]. a strategi si is call a threshold strategi, if there exist a vector x of threshold valu such that si is a threshold strategi base on x. 3. implement with a limit number of action in thi section, we studi the gener model of  actionbound mechan design. our first result is a suffici and necessari condit for the implement of the  optim solut achiev with k action: thi condit sai that the optim social-choic rule is achiev when all the 4 for simplic, we assum that a maximum is attain and thu the optim function is well defin. player us non-decreas strategi. the basic idea is that with non-decreas strategi (i.e., threshold strategi), we can appli the singl-cross properti to show that when a player rais hi report action, the expect valu for hi high-prioriti altern increas faster; therefor,  monoton must hold. the result hold for ani number of  player and altern, and for ani profil of distribut  function on the player" type, as long as thei ar statist independ. (it is easi to illustr that thi result doe not hold if the player" type ar depend.) lemma 1. consid a singl-cross social-valu  function g. the information optim k-action social-choic function c∗ (with respect to g) is implement if and onli if c∗ achiev it optimum when the player us non-decreas strategi. next, we show that for a wide famili of social-valu  function - multilinear function - the price of implement is zero. that is, the inform-theoret optim rule is domin-strategi implement. thi famili of  function captur mani common set from the literatur. in particular, it gener the auction set studi by blumrosen et al. [4, 6]. definit 10. a multilinear function is a polynomi in which the degre of everi variabl in each monomi is at most 1.5 we sai that a social-choic rule g is multilinear, if g(·, a) is multilinear for everi altern a ∈ a. the basic idea behind the proof of the follow theorem is as follow: for everi player, we show that the expect social welfar when he choos ani action (fix the strategi of the other player) is a linear function of hi type. thi is a result of the multilinear of the social-valu function and of the linear of expect. the maximum over a set of linear function is a piecewis-linear function, henc the  optim social valu is achiev when the player us threshold strategi (the threshold ar the switch point). sinc the optimum is achiev with threshold strategi, we can appli lemma 1 to show the monoton of thi  socialchoic rule. note that in thi argument we character the player" strategi that maxim the social valu, and not the player" util. theorem 1. if the social-valu function is multilinear and singl cross, the information optim k-action social-choic function is implement. proof. we will show that for ani k-action mechan, the optim expect social valu is achiev when all  player us threshold strategi. thi will be shown by prove that for ani player i and for ani action bi of player i, the expect welfar when she choos the action bi is a  linear function in player i"s type θi. then, it will follow from lemma 1 that the social choic function is implement. for everi action bi of player i, let qa denot the  probabl that altern a is alloc, i.e., qa = pr−→ θ h t(s( −→ θ )) = a|si(θi) = bi i 5 for exampl, f(x, y, z) = xyz + 5xy + 7. 66 due to the linear of expect, the expect social valu when player i with type θi report bi is: x a∈a qa eθ−i ( g(θi, θ−i, a) | t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = a ) (1) = x a∈a qa z θ−i g(θi, θ−i, a)fa −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) (2) where fa −i(θ−i) equal q j=i fj (θj ) qa for type profil θ−i such that t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = a, and 0 otherwis. sinc g is multilinear, everi function g(θi, θ−i, a) is a  linear function in θi, where the coeffici depend on the  valu of θ−i. denot thi function by g(θi, θ−i, a) = λθ−i θi + βθ−i . thu, we can write equat 2 as: x a∈a qa z θ−i ` λθ−i θi + βθ−i ´ fa −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) = x a∈a qa θi z θ−i λθ−i fa −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) + z θ−i βθ−i fa −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) ! in thi express, each integr is a constant  independ of θi when the strategi of the other player ar fix. therefor, each summand, thu the whole function, is a  linear function in θi. for achiev the optim expect social valu, the player must choos the action that maxim the expect social valu. a maximum of k linear function is a piecewis-linear function with at most k−1 break point. these break point ar the threshold to be us by the player. for all type between subsequ threshold, the optimum is clearli achiev by a singl action; sinc linear function ar singl-cross, everi action will be maxim in at most on interv. the same argument appli to all the player, and  therefor the optim social valu is obtain with threshold strategi. observ that the proof of theorem 1 actual work for a more gener set. for prove that the  informationtheoret optim result is achiev with threshold  strategi, it is suffici to show that the social-choic function exhibit a singl-cross condit on expect: given ani alloc scheme, and fix the behavior of the other player, the expect social valu in ani two action (as a function of θi) is singl cross. theorem 1 show that thi requir hold for multilinear function, but we were not abl to give an exact character of thi gener class of function. the implement of the inform-theoret  optim solut make the character of the optim incent-compat mechan significantli easier: we can appli the standard mechan-design techniqu and first calcul the optim alloc scheme and then find the right payment. observ that if the valuat function of the player ar linear and singl cross, then the social-welfar function (i.e., the sum of the player" valuat) is multilinear and singl-cross. thi hold sinc the singl-cross  condit on the valuat ar defin with a similar order on the altern as in the social-valu function. therefor, an immedi conclus from theorem 1 is that the  optim social welfar, which is achiev with k action, is implement when the valuat ar linear. corollari 1. if the valuat function vi(·, a) ar  singl cross and linear in θi for everi player i and for everi altern, then the information optim k-action social welfar function is implement. 3.1 asymptot analysi in thi section we show that the social valu loss of  multilinear social-valu rule diminish quadrat with the number of possibl action, k. thi is the same asymptot ratio present in the studi of specif model in the same spirit [19, 5, 18, 9]. the main challeng here, compar to earlier result, is in deal with the gener  mechanismdesign framework, that allow a larg famili of social-valu function for ani number of player and altern. as  oppos to the specif model, the social-valu function mai be asymmetr with respect to the player" type; for  instanc, the social-valu loss mai a-priori occur in ani  entri (i.e., profil of action). the basic intuit for the proof is that even for thi  gener framework, we can construct mechan where the probabl of have an alloc that is incompat with the origin social-choic function is o( 1 k ). (thi fact hold for all singl-cross social-choic function, not onli for multilinear function.) then, we can us the multilinear to show that the social-valu loss will alwai be o( 1 k ) in the mechan we construct. taken togeth, the expect loss becom o( 1 k2 ). our proof is construct - we present an explicit construct for a mechan that exhibit the desir loss in domin strategi. the addit expect social-valu depend on the length of the support of the type space. henc, we assum that the type space is normal to [0, 1], that is, for everi player i, θi = 0 and θi = 1. theorem 2. assum that the type space ar normal to [0, 1]. for ani number of player and altern, and for ani set of distribut function of the player" type, if the social-valu function g is singl cross and  multilinear, then the information optim k-action social-choic function (with respect to g) incur an expect social-valu loss of o( 1 k2 ). moreov, as discuss in [4], thi bound is asymptot tight. that is, there exist a set of distribut function for the player (the uniform distribut in particular) and there ar social-valu function (e.g., auction) for which ani mechan incur a social-valu loss of at least Ω( 1 k2 ). in that sens, auction ar the hardest problem with respect to the incur loss. yet, note that thi claim doe not impli that the loss of ani social-choic function will be  proport to 1 k2 . for exampl, in the social choic function that choos the same altern for ani type profil, no loss will be incur (even with 0 action). 67 4. optim mechan for two player and two altern in thi section, we present a full character of the optim mechan in action-bound environ with two player and two altern, where the social-choic function ar multilinear and singl cross. note that in thi section, as in most part of thi paper, we character monoton mechan by their alloc scheme and by a profil of strategi for the player. do thi, we complet describ which altern is chosen for everi profil of type of the player. it is well known that in monoton mechan for on dimension environ, the alloc scheme uniqu defin the payment in the domin-strategi implement. we find thi  descript, which doe not explicitli mention the payment, easier for the present. a kei notion in our character of the optim  actionbound mechan, is the notion of non-degener  mechan. in a degener mechan, there ar two action for on of the player that ar ident in their alloc. intuit, a degenr mechan doe not util all the action space it is allow to us, and therefor it cannot be optim. us thi properi, we then defin diagon mechan that turn out to exactli character the set of optim mechan. definit 11. a mechan is degener with respect to player i if there exist two action bi, bi for player i such that for all profil b−i of action of the other player, the alloc scheme is ident whether player i report bi or bi (i.e., ∀b−i, t(bi, b−i) = t(bi, b−i)). for exampl, a 2-player mechan is degener with  respect to the row player, if there ar two row with  ident alloc in the matrix represent of the game. definit 12. a 2-player 2-altern mechan with k-possibl action is call diagon if it is monoton, and non-degener with respect to at least on of the player. the term diagon origin from the matrix  represent of these mechan, in which on of the diagon determin the boundari between the choic of the two  altern (see figur 1). simpl combinatori  consider show that diagon mechan mai come in veri few form. interestingli, on of these form is degener with respect to on of the player; that is, it can be describ as a mechan with k − 1 action for thi player. proposit 2. ani diagon 2-player mechan ha on of the follow form: 1. if both player favor the same altern (w.l.o.g., b i a for i = 1, 2) then either (a). t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1 (b). t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. 2. if the two player have conflict prefer (e.g., a 1 b and b 2 a) then either (a). t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 ≥ b2 (b). t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 > b2. in both case, the optim mechan can also take the form of on of the possibl describ, except on of the player is not allow to choos the fix alloc action. to complet the descript of the optim alloc scheme, we now move to determin the optim strategi in diagon mechan. we defin the notion of  mutuallymaxim threshold, and show that threshold strategi base on such threshold ar optim. the reason why mutual-maxim strategi maxim the expect social valu in monoton mechan is intuit: consid some action i (row in the matrix represent) for player 1. in a monoton mechan, the alloc in such a row will be of the form [a, a, ..., b, b] (assum that b 2 a). that is, the altern a will be chosen for low action of player 2, and the altern b will be chosen for higher action of player 2. by determin a threshold for player 2, the social planner actual determin the minim type of player 2 from which the altern b will be chosen. for  optim the expect social valu, thi type for player 2 should clearli be the type for which the expect social valu from a equal the expect social valu from b (given that player 1 plai i); for greater valu of player 2, the singl-cross condit ensur that b will be prefer. definit 13. consid a monoton 2-player  mechan g that is non-degener with respect to the two  player, where the player us threshold strategi base on the threshold vector x, y. we sai that the threshold xi of on player (w.l.o.g. player 1) is a maxim if eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, a) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) = eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, b) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) where j is the action of player 2 for which the mechan swap the chosen altern exactli when player 1 plai i, i.e., t(i, j) = t(i − 1, j) (we denot, w.l.o.g., t(i, j) = a, t(i − 1, j) = b). the threshold vector x, y ar call mutual maxim if all their threshold ar maxim (except the first and the last). it turn out that in 2-player, 2-altern environ, where the social-choic rule is multilinear and singl  cross, the optim expect social valu is achiev in  diagon mechan with mutual-maxim strategi. in the proof, we start with a k × k alloc matrix, and show that the mechan cannot be degener with respect to on of the player (we show how to choos thi player). if the player, w.l.o.g., the column player, is degener, then there ar two column with an ident alloc. these two column can be unifi to a singl action, and the  mechan can therefor be describ as a k × k − 1 matrix. we then show that we can insert a new miss column, and an appropri chosen threshold, and strictli increas the expect social valu in the mechan. therefor, the  origin mechan wa not the optim k-action mechan. theorem 3. in environ with two altern and two player, if the social-valu function is multilinear and singl cross, then the optim k-action mechan is  diagon, and the optimum is achiev with threshold strategi that ar mutual maxim. a corollari from the proof of theorem 1 is that the optim 2-player k-action mechan mai be degener for on of the player (that is, equival to a game where on of the player ha onli k − 1 differ action). howev, the proof identifi the follow suffici condit under which the 68 0 1 2 3 0 a a a b 1 a a b b 2 a b b b 3 b b b b 0 1 2 3 0 a a a a 1 a a a b 2 a a b b 3 a b b b 0 1 2 3 0 b b b b 1 a b b b 2 a a b b 3 a a a b 0 1 2 3 0 a a a b 1 a a b b 2 a b b b figur 1: the three left tabl show all possibl diagon alloc scheme with 4 possibl action for each player. the rightmost tabl show an exampl for a diagon alloc scheme where on of the player ha onli k − 1 possibl action. optim mechan will be non-degener with respect to both player: if the player" prefer ar correl (e.g., a 1 b and a 2 b), then the optim altern must be the same under the profil (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). similarli, if the player" prefer ar conflict (e.g., a 1 b and b 2 a), then the optim altern must be the same under the profil (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). exampl in which thi condit hold ar the public good model present in section 5 and auction [5]. we do not know how to give an exact character of the optim mechan in multi-player and multi-alternati ve environ. the hard stem from the fact that the necessari condit we specifi befor for the optim of the mechan (i.e., non-degenr and monoton  alloc) ar not restrict enough for the gener model. in other word, for n > 2 player, the number of monoton and non-degener mechan becom exponenti in n. proposit 3. the number of monoton non-  degener k-action mechan in an n-player game is exponenti in n, even if |a| = 2. 5. exampl our result appli to a varieti of econom, comput and network set. in thi section, we demonstr the applic of our result to public-good model, signal game and rout applic. 5.1 applic 1: public good the public-good model deal with a social planner (e.g., govern) that need to decid whether to suppli a  public good, such as build a bridg. let y es and no denot the respect altern of build and not build the bridg. v = v1, . . . , vn is the vector of the player"  typesth valu thei gain from us the bridg. the decis that maxim the social welfar is to build the bridg if and onli if p i vi is greater than it cost, denot by c. if the bridg is built, the social welfar is p i vi − c, and zero otherwis; thu, g(v, y es) = p i vi − c, and g(v, no) = 0. the util of player i under payment pi is ui = vi − pi if the bridg is built, and 0 otherwis. it is well-known that under no  restrict on the action space, it is possibl to induc truth revel by vcg mechan, therefor full effici can be achiev. obvious, when the action set is limit to k action, we cannot achiev full effici due to the  inform constraint. yet, sinc g(v, y es) and g(v, no) ar multilinear and singl cross, we can directli appli theorem 1. henc, the inform-theoret optim  kaction mechan is implement in domin strategi. corollari 2. the k-action information optim  social welfar in the n-player public-good game is implement in domin strategi. moreov, as theorem 3 suggest, in the k-action 2-player public-good game, we can fulli character the optim mechan. in the proof of theorem 3, we saw that when for both player g(θi, θi, a) = g(θi, θi, b), the mechan is non-degener with respect to both player.6 thi  condit clearli hold here (1+ 0− c = 0+ 1− c), therefor the optim mechan will us all k action. corollari 3. the optim expect welfar in a 2-player k-action public-good game is achiev with on of the  follow mechan:7 1. alloc: build the bridg iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. strategi: threshold strategi base on the vector −→x ,−→y where for everi 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, xi = c − e[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i, yk−i+1]] yi = c − e[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i, xk−i+1]] 2. alloc: build the bridg iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1. strategi: threshold strategi base on the vector −→x ,−→y where for everi 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1: xi = c − e[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i−1, yk−i]] yi = c − e[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i−1, xk−i]] recal that we defin the optim mechan by their  alloc scheme and by the optim strategi for the  player. it is well known, that the alloc scheme in  monoton mechan uniqu defin the payment that ensur incent-compat. in public-good game, these  payment satisfi the rule that a player pai hi lowest valu for which the bridg is built, when the action of the other player is fix. therefor, the payment for the player 1 and 2  report the action b1 and b2 ar as follow: in mechan 1 from proposit 3, p1 = xb2 and p2 = yb1 ; in mechan 2 from proposit 3, p1 = xb2−1 and p2 = yb1−1. we now show a more specif exampl that assum  uniform distribut. the exampl show how the optim mechan is determin by the cost c: for low cost,  mechan of type 1 is optim, and for high cost the optim mechan is of type 2. an addit interest featur of the optim mechan in the exampl is that thei ar  symmetr with respect to the player. thi come as oppos to the optim mechan in the auction model [5] that ar asymmetr (even when the player" valu ar drawn from ident distribut). 6 more precis, the condit for non-degeneraci when b 1 a and b 2 a is that sign(g(θi, θi, a)−g(θi, θi, b)) = sign(g(θi, θi, a) − g(θi, θi, b)) (when sign(0) is consid both neg and posit). 7 we denot x0 = y0 = 0 and xk = yk = 1. 69 c ≤ 1 0 1 0 no p1 = p2 = 0 no p1 = p2 = 0 1 no p1 = p2 = 0 ye p1 = p2 = 2 3 c − 1 3 c ≥ 1 0 1 0 no p1 = p2 = 0 ye p1 = 0; p2 = 2c 3 1 ye p1 = 2c 3 ; p2 = 0 ye p1 = p2 = 0 figur 2: optim mechan in a 2-player, 2-altern, 2-action public-good game, when the type ar uniformli distribut in [0, 1]. the mechan on the left is optim when c ≤ 1 and the other is optim when c ≥ 1. exampl 1. suppos that the type of both player ar uniformli distribut on [0, 1]. figur 2 illustr the  optim mechan for k = 2, and show how both the  alloc scheme and the payment depend on the construct cost c. then, the welfar-maxim mechan ar: • if the cost of build is at least 1: alloc: build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k strategi: the threshold of both player ar (for i = {1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2(k−i)·c 2k−1 − 2k−4i+1 2k−1 • if the cost of build is smaller than 1: alloc: build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1 strategi: the threshold of both player ar (for i = {1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2ic 2k−1 5.2 applic 2: signal we now studi a signal model in labor market. in thi model, the type of each worker, θi ∈ [θ, θ], describ the worker"s product level. the firm want to make her hire decis accord to a decis function f( −→ θ ). for exampl, the firm mai want to hire the most product worker (like the auction model), or hire a group of  worker onli if their sum of product is greater than some threshold (similar to the public-good model). howev, the worker"s product is invis to the firm; the firm onli observ the worker"s educ level e that should convei signal about her product level. note that the  assumpt here is that acquir educ, at ani level, doe not affect the product of the worker, but onli signal about the worker"s skill. a main compon in thi model, is the fact that as the worker is more product, it is easier for him to acquir high-level educ. in addit, the cost of acquir  educ increas with the educ level. more formal, a continu function c(e, θ) describ the cost to a worker from acquir each educ level as a function of hi  product. the standard assumpt about the cost  function ar: ∂c ∂e > 0, ∂c ∂θ < 0, ∂c ∂e∂θ < 0, where the latter  requir is exactli equival to the singl-cross  properti (when c is differenti in both variabl). the util of a worker is determin accord to the educ level he choos and the wage w(e) attach to thi educ level, that is, ui(e, θi) = −c(θi, e) + w(e). an action for a worker in thi game is the educ level he choos to acquir. in standard model, thi action space is continu, and then a fulli separ equilibrium  exist (under the singl-cross condit on the cost  function). that is, there exist an equilibrium in which everi type is map into a differ educ level; thu, the firm can induc the exact product level of the worker by thi signal mechan. howev, it is hard to imagin a world with a continuum of educ level. it is usual the case that there ar onli sever discret educ level (e.g., bsc, msc, phd). with k educ level, the firm mai not be abl to  exactli follow the decis function f. for achiev the best result in k action, the firm mai want the worker to plai  accord to specif threshold strategi. it turn out that the standard condit, the singl-cross condit on the cost function, suffic for ensur that these threshold strategi will be domin for the player. we can now appli  theorem 2, and show that if the decis function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decis ar made to maxim a set of multilinear function), then the firm can design the educ system such that the expect loss will be o( 1 k2 ), with a domin-strategi equilibrium. note that while in the classic exampl of the job market it is not reason for each firm to select the educ level, in other reason applic the social planner mai be abl to determin the threshold, e.g., by fix the level of qualifi exam or other mean for the player to demonstr their skill. corollari 4. consid a multilinear decis function f, and a singl-cross cost function for the player. with k educ level, the firm can implement in domin  strategi a decis function that incur a loss of o( 1 k2 ) compar with the decis function f. 5.3 applic 3: rout in our last exampl, we show the applic of our  result to rout in lossi network. in such system, a sender need to decid through which network to transmit hi  messag. it is natur to assum that the agent (i.e., link) mai not be abl to report their accur probabl of success, but onli, e.g., whether these ar low, intermedi, or high. in thi exampl, we focu on parallel-path network. let n1, n2 denot two network, where each network is compos of multipl parallel path with variabl length from a given sourc to a given sink (an exampl for such a network appear in figur 3). the edg in these network ar control by differ selfish agent, and each edg  appear onli in on of the network. suppos that the sender, who wish to send a messag from the sourc to the sink, know the topolog of each network, but the probabl of success on each link, pi, is the link"s privat inform. the problem of the sender is to decid whether to send a messag through the network n1 or through an altern network n2. obvious, the sender wish to send the  messag through n1 onli if the total probabl of success in n1 is greater than the success probabl in n2. let fn (−→p )  denot the probabl of success in network n with a  successprob vector −→p . the social choic function in thi  exampl is thu: c(−→p ) ∈ argmax{n1,n2}{fn1 (−→p ), fn2 (−→p )}. 70 p5p4 p3 p2p1 s t figur 3: an exampl for a parallel-path network, where each link ha a probabl pi for transmiss  success. we show that the overal probabl of success in such network is multilinear in pi, and thu the optim k-action social-choic function is domin-strategi  implement. in thi exampl, we assum that everi agent ha a  singlecross valuat function over the altern. that is, each player wish that the messag will be sent through hi network, and hi benefit is posit correl with hi secret data (e.g., the valuat of player i mai be exactli pi). we would like to emphas that the social planner in thi exampl (the sender) doe not aim to maxim the social welfar. that is, the social valu is not the sum of the player" type nor ani weight sum of the type (affin maxim). the success probabl of send a messag through a parallel-path network is multilinear, sinc it can be express by the follow multilinear formula (where p denot the set of all path between the sourc and the sink): 1 − y p ∈p (1 − y j∈p pj) (3) for exampl, in the network present in figur 3, the probabl of success is given by f(−→p ) = 1 − (1 − p1p2) · (1 − p3) · (1 − p4p5) thu, if all the candid network ar parallel-path  network, the social-valu function is multilinear, and we can appli theorem 1 and get the follow corollari. note that for everi link i, the partial deriv in pi of the success probabl written in equat 3 is posit. in all the other network, that do not contain link i, the partial deriv is clearli zero. therefor, the social-valu function is singl cross and our gener result can be appli. corollari 5. for ani social-choic function that  maxim the success probabl over parallel-path network, the information optim k-action social-choic function is implement (for ani k). acknowledg. we thank noam nisan for help  discuss and anonym refere for help comment. thi work is support by grant from the isra academi of scienc and the usa-israel binat scienc foundat. the work of the second author is also support by the ladi davi trust fellowship. 6. refer [1] s. athei. singl cross properti and the exist of pure strategi equilibria in game of incomplet inform. econometrica, 69(4):861-89, 2001.
