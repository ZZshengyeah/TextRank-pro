{van.parunak, sven.brueckner, robert.matthew, john.sauter, steve.brophi}@newvector.net abstract reason about agent that we observ in the world is  challeng. our avail inform is often limit to observ of the agent"s extern behavior in the past and present. to  understand these action, we need to deduc the agent"s intern state, which includ not onli ration element (such as intent and plan), but also emot on (such as fear). in addit, we often want to predict the agent"s futur action, which ar constrain not onli by these inward characterist, but also by the dynam of the agent"s interact with it environ. bee (behavior evolut and extrapol) us a faster-than-real-time  agentbas model of the environ to character agent" intern state by evolut against observ behavior, and then predict their futur behavior, take into account the dynam of their interact with the environ. categori and subject descriptor i.2.6 [artifici intellig]: learn - paramet learn. i.2.11 [artifici intellig]: distribut artifici  intellig- multiag system. gener term algorithm, measur, experiment. 1. introduct reason about agent that we observ in the world must integr two dispar level. our observ ar often limit to the agent"s extern behavior, which can frequent be  summar numer as a trajectori in space-time (perhap  punctuat by action from a fairli limit vocabulari). howev, thi behavior is driven by the agent"s intern state, which (in the case of a human) mai involv high-level psycholog and cognit concept such as intent and emot. a central challeng in mani applic domain is reason from extern observ of agent behavior to an estim of their intern state. such  reason is motiv by a desir to predict the agent"s behavior. thi problem ha tradition been address under the  rubric of plan recognit or plan infer. work to date  focus almost entir on recogn the ration state (as oppos to the emot state) of a singl agent (as oppos to an  interact commun), and frequent take advantag of explicit  commun between agent (as in manag convers  protocol). mani realist problem deviat from these condit. increas the number of agent lead to a combinatori  explos that can swamp convent analysi. environment dynam can frustrat agent intent. the agent often ar try to hide their intent (and even their presenc), rather than intention share inform. an agent"s emot state mai be at least as import as it ration state in determin it behavior. domain that exhibit these constraint can often be  character as adversari, and includ militari combat, competit busi tactic, and multi-player comput game. bee (behavior evolut and extrapol) is a novel  approach to recogn the ration and emot state of multipl interact agent base sole on their behavior, without recours to intent commun from them. it is inspir by  techniqu us to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynam  system, in which a represent of the system is continu fit to it recent past behavior. for nonlinear dynam system, the  represent is a close-form mathemat equat. in bee, it is a set of paramet govern the behavior of softwar agent  repres the individu be analyz. the current version of bee character and predict the behavior of agent  repres soldier engag in urban combat [8]. section 2 review relev previou work. section 3  describ the architectur of bee. section 4 report result from experi with the system. section 5 conclud. further detail that cannot be includ here for the sake of space ar avail in an on-line technic report [16]. 2. previou work bee bear comparison with previou research in ai (plan recognit), hidden markov model, and nonlinear dynam system (trajectori predict). 2.1 plan recognit in ai agent theori commonli describ an agent"s cognit state in term of it belief, desir, and intent (the so-call bdi model [5, 20]). an agent"s belief ar proposit about the state of the world that it consid true, base on it percept. it desir ar proposit about the world that it would like to be true. desir ar not necessarili consist with on anoth: an agent might desir both to be rich and not to work at the same time. an agent"s intent, or goal, ar a subset of it desir that it ha select, base on it belief, to guid it futur action. unlik desir, goal must be consist with on anoth (or at least believ to be consist by the agent). an agent"s goal guid it action. thu on ought to be abl to learn someth about an agent"s goal by observ it past action, and knowledg of the agent"s goal in turn enabl  conclus about what the agent mai do in the futur. thi process of reason from an agent"s action to it goal is known as plan recognit or plan infer. thi bodi of work (survei recent at [3]) is rich and vari. it cover both singl-agent and multi-agent (e.g., robot soccer team) plan,  intent vs. non-intent action, speech vs. non-speech  behavior, adversari vs. cooper intent, complet vs. incomplet world knowledg, and correct vs. faulti plan, among other  dimens. plan recognit is seldom pursu for it own sake. it  usual support a higher-level function. for exampl, in  humancomput interfac, recogn a user"s plan can enabl the  system to provid more appropri inform and option for user action. in a tutor system, infer the student"s plan is a first step to identifi buggi plan and provid appropri  remedi. in mani case, the higher-level function is predict like futur action by the entiti whose plan is be infer. we focu on plan recognit in support of predict. an agent"s plan is a necessari input to a predict of it futur  behavior, but hardli a suffici on. at least two other influenc, on intern and on extern, need to be taken into account. the extern influenc is the dynam of the environ, which mai includ other agent. the dynam of the real world impos signific constraint. the environ mai interfer with the desir of the agent [4, 10]. most interact among agent, and between agent and the world, ar nonlinear. when iter, these can gener chao (extrem sensit to initi condit). a ration analysi of an agent"s goal mai enabl us to  predict what it will attempt, but ani nontrivi plan with sever step will depend sensit at each step to the reaction of the  environ, and our predict must take thi reaction into account as well. actual simul of futur is on wai (the onli on we know now) to deal with the impact of environment dynam on an agent"s action. human agent ar also subject to an intern influenc. the agent"s emot state can  modul it decis process and it focu of attent (and thu it percept of the environ). in extrem case, emot can lead an agent to choos action that from the standpoint of a  logic analysi mai appear irrat. current work on plan recognit for  predict focus on the ration plan, and doe not take into account either extern environment influenc or intern emot bias. bee  integr all three element into it predict. 2.2 hidden markov model bee is superfici similar to hidden markov model (hmm"s [19]). in both case, the agent ha hidden intern state (the agent"s person) and observ state (it outward  behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observ state (by evolut in bee, by the baum-welch algorithm [1] in hmm"s) and then predict the agent"s futur behavior (by  extrapol via ghost in bee, by the forward algorithm in hmm"s). bee offer two import benefit over hmm"s. first, a singl agent"s hidden variabl do not satisfi the markov properti. that is, their valu at t + 1 depend not onli on their valu at t, but also on the hidden variabl of other agent. on could avoid thi limit by construct a singl hmm over the joint state space of all of the agent, but thi approach is combinatori prohibit. bee combin the effici of  independ model individu agent with the realiti of take into account interact among them. second, markov model assum that transit probabl ar stationari. thi assumpt is unrealist in dynam  situat. bee"s evolutionari process continu updat the agent" person base on actual observ, and thu automat account for chang in the agent" person. 2.3 real-time nonlinear system fit mani system of interest can be describ by a vector of real number that chang as a function of time. the dimens of the vector defin the system"s state space. on typic analyz such system as vector differenti equat, e.g., )(xf dt xd . when f is nonlinear, the system can be formal chaotic, and start point arbitrarili close to on anoth can lead to  trajectori that diverg exponenti rapidli. long-rang predict of such a system is imposs. howev, it is often us to  anticip the system"s behavior a short distanc into the futur. a  common techniqu is to fit a conveni function form for f to the system"s trajectori in the recent past, then extrapol thi fit into the futur (figur 1, [7]). thi process is repeat constantli,  provid the user with a limit look-ahead. thi approach is robust and wide appli, but requir  system that can effici be describ with mathemat  equat. bee extend thi approach to agent behavior, which it fit to observ behavior us a genet algorithm. 3. architectur bee predict the futur by observ the emerg behavior of agent repres the entiti of interest in a fine-grain agent simul. kei element of the bee  architectur includ the model of an individu agent, the pheromon infrastructur through which agent interact, the inform sourc that guid them, and the overal evolutionari cycl that thei execut. 3.1 agent model the agent in bee ar inspir by two  bodi of work: our previou work on fine-grain agent that coordin their action through  digit pheromon in a share environ [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previou  agentbas combat model. digit pheromon ar scalar variabl that agent deposit and sens at their current locat a c b d a c b d figur 1: track a  nonlinear dynam system. a = system state space; b = system trajectori over time; c = recent measur of system state; d = short-rang predict. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 1427 in the environ. agent respond to local concentr of these variabl tropist, climb or descend local  gradient. their movement chang the deposit pattern. thi feedback loop, togeth with process of evapor and propag in the environ, support complex pattern of interact and  coordin among the agent [15]. tabl 1 show the bee"s  current pheromon flavor. for exampl, a live member of the  adversari emit a red-aliv pheromon, while road emit a mobil pheromon. our soldier agent ar inspir by einstein and mana. einstein [6] repres an agent as a set of six weight, each in [-1, 1], describ the agent"s respons to six kind of  inform. four of these describ the number of aliv friendli, aliv enemi, injur friendli, and injur enemi troop within the agent"s sensor rang. the other two weight relat to the agent"s distanc to it own flag and that of the adversari, repres object that it seek to protect and attack, respect. a  posit weight indic attract to the entiti describ by the weight, while a neg weight indic repuls. mana [9] extend the concept in einstein. friendli and enemi flag ar replac by the waypoint pursu by each side. mana includ low, medium, and high threat enemi. in  addit, it defin a set of trigger (e.g., reach a waypoint, be shot at, make contact with the enemi, be injur) that shift the agent from on person vector to anoth. a default state defin the person vector when no trigger state is activ. the person vector in mana and einstein reflect both ration and emot aspect of decis-make. the notion of be attract or repel by friendli or adversari forc in variou state of health is an import compon of what we inform think of as emot (e.g., fear, compass,  aggress), and the us of the term person in both einstein and mana suggest that the system design ar think  anthropomorph, though thei do not us emot to describ the effect thei ar try to achiev. the notion of waypoint to which an agent is attract reflect goal-orient ration. bee us an integr ration-emot person model. a bee agent"s ration is a vector of seven desir, which ar valu in [-1, +1]: protectr (the adversari), protectblu (friendli forc), protectgreen (civilian), protectkeysit, avoidcombat, avoiddetect, and surviv. neg valu revers the sens suggest by the label. for exampl, a neg valu of protectr indic a desir to harm red, and an agent with a high posit desir to protectr will be attract to  redal, red-casualti, and mobil pheromon, and will move at maximum speed. the emot compon of a bee"s person is base on the ortoni-clore-collin (occ) framework [11], and is describ in detail elsewher [12]. occ defin emot as valanc  reaction to agent, state, or event in the environ. thi notion of reaction is captur in mana"s trigger state. an import advanc in bee"s emot model is the recognit that agent mai differ in how sensit thei ar to trigger. for exampl, threaten situat tend to stimul the emot of fear, but a given level of threat will produc more fear in a new recruit than in a season veteran. thu our model includ not onli  emot, but disposit. each emot ha a correspond  disposit. disposit ar rel stabl, and consid constant over the time horizon of a run of the bee, while emot vari base on the agent"s disposit and the stimuli to which it is  expos. interview with militari domain expert identifi the two most crucial emot for combat behavior as anger (with the correspond disposit irrit) and fear (whose disposit is cowardic). tabl 2 show which pheromon trigger which emot. for exampl, red-casualti pheromon stimul both anger and fear in a red agent, but not in a blue agent.  emot ar model as agent hormon (intern pheromon) that ar augment in the presenc of the trigger environment condit and evapor over time. a non-zero emot modifi the agent"s action. elev level anger increas movement likelihood, weapon fire  likelihood, and tendenc toward an expos postur. elev fear decreas these likelihood. figur 2 summar the bee"s person model. the left side is a straightforward bdi model (we prefer the term goal to intent). the right side is the emot compon, where an apprais of the agent"s belief, moder by the disposit, lead to an emot that in turn influenc the bdi analysi. tabl 1. pheromon flavor in bee pheromon flavor descript redal redcasualti bluealiv

infrastructur that  implement it. 3.2.1 overview figur 3 is an overview of  behavior evolut and extrapol. each activ entiti in the battlespac ha an persist avatar that continu  gener a stream of ghost agent  repres itself. we call the combin model entiti consist of avatar and ghost a polyag [14]. ghost live on a timelin index by that begin in the past and run into the futur. is offset with respect to the current time t. the timelin is divid into discret page, each repres a success valu of . the avatar insert the ghost at the  insert horizon. in our current system, the insert horizon is at - t = -30, mean that ghost ar insert into a page repres the state of the world 30 minut ago. at the insert horizon, each ghost"s behavior paramet (desir and disposit) ar sampl from distribut to explor altern person of the entiti it repres. each page between the insert horizon and = t (now) record the histor state of the world at the point in the past to which it correspond. as ghost move from page to page, thei interact with thi past state, base on their behavior paramet. these interact mean that their fit depend not just on their own action, but also on the behavior of the rest of the  popul, which is also evolv. becaus advanc faster than real time, eventu = t (actual time). at thi point, each ghost is evalu base on it locat compar with the actual locat of it correspond real-world entiti. the fittest ghost have three function. 1. the person of each entiti"s fittest ghost is report to the rest of the system as the like person of that entiti. thi inform enabl us to character individu warrior as unusu cowardli or brave. 2. the fittest ghost breed genet and their offspr return to the insert horizon to continu the fit process. 3. the fittest ghost for each entiti form the basi for a popul of ghost that run past the avatar's present into the futur. each ghost that run into the futur explor a differ possibl futur of the battl, analog to how some peopl plan ahead by mental simul differ wai that a situat might unfold. analysi of the behavior of these differ possibl futur yield predict. thu bee ha three distinct notion of time, all of which mai be distinct from real-world time. 1. domain time t is the current time in the domain be model. if bee is appli to a real-world situat, thi time is the same as real-world time. in our experi, we appli bee to a simul battl, and domain time is the time stamp publish by the simul. dure actual run, the simul is often paus, so domain time run slower than real time. when we replai log from simul run, we can speed them up so that domain time run faster than real time. 2. bee time for a page record the domain time correspond to the state of the world repres on that page, and is offset from the current domain time. 3. shift time is increment everi time the ghost move from on page to the next. the relat between shift time and real time depend on the process resourc avail. 3.2.2 pheromon infrastructur bee must oper veri rapidli, to keep pace with the ongo battl. thu we us simpl agent coordin us pheromon mechan. we have describ the basic dynam of our pheromon  infrastructur elsewher [2]. thi infrastructur run on the node of a graph-structur environ (in the case of bee, a rectangular lattic). each node maintain a scalar valu for each flavor of pheromon, and provid three function: it aggreg deposit from individu agent, fuse inform across multipl agent and through time. it evapor pheromon over time, provid an innov altern to tradit truth mainten. tradition, knowledg base rememb everyth thei ar told unless thei have a reason to forget. pheromon-base system immedi begin to forget everyth thei learn, unless it is continu reinforc. thu inconsist automat remov themselv within a known period. it diffus pheromon to nearbi place, dissemin inform for access by nearbi agent. the distribut of each pheromon flavor over the  environ form a field that repres some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time. each page of the timelin is a  complet pheromon field for the world at the bee time repres by that page. the behavior of the pheromon on each page  depend on whether the page repres the past or the futur. environ belief desir goal emot disposit state process analysi action percept apprais ration emot figur 2: bee"s integr ration and emot person model ghost time =t(now) avatar insert horizon

and the fittest ghost run into the futur to gener predict. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 1429 in page repres the futur ( > t), the usual pheromon mechan appli. ghost deposit pheromon each time thei move to a new page, and pheromon evapor and propag from on page to the next. in page repres the past ( t), we have an observ state of the real world. thi ha two consequ for pheromon manag. first, we can gener the pheromon field directli from the observ locat of individu entiti, so there is no need for the ghost to make deposit. second, we can adjust the pheromon intens base on the chang locat of entiti from page to page, so we do not need to evapor or propag the pheromon. both of these simplif reflect the fact that in our current system, we have complet knowledg of the past. when we introduc nois and uncertainti, we will probabl need to introduc dynam pheromon in the past as well as the futur. execut of the pheromon infrastructur proce on two time scale, run in separ thread. the first thread updat the book of page each time the  domain time advanc past the next page boundari. at each step, the former now + 1page is replac with a new current page, whose pheromon correspond to the locat and strength of observ unit; an empti page is ad at the predict horizon; the oldest page is discard, sinc it ha pass the insert horizon. the second thread move the ghost from on page to the next, as fast as the processor allow. at each step, ghost reach the = t page ar evalu for fit and remov or evolv; new ghost from the avatar and from the evolutionari process ar insert at the insert horizon; a popul of ghost base on the fittest ghost ar insert at = t to run into the futur; ghost that have move beyond the predict horizon ar remov; all ghost plan their next action base on the pheromon field in the page thei current occupi; the system comput the next state of each page, includ execut the action elect by the ghost, and (in futur page) evapor pheromon and record new deposit from the recent arriv ghost. ghost movement base on pheromon gradient is a simpl process, so thi system can support realist agent popul without excess comput load. in our current system, each  avatar gener eight ghost per shift. sinc there ar about 50  entiti in the battlespac (about 20 unit each of red and blue and about 5 of green), we must support about 400 ghost per page, or about 24000 over the entir book. how fast a processor do we need? let p be the real-time  durat of a page in second. if each page repres 60 second of domain time, and we ar replai a simul at 2x domain time, p = 30. let n be the number of page between the insert horizon and = t. in our current system, n = 30. then a shift rate of n/p shift per second will permit ghost to run from the  insert horizon to the current time at least onc befor a new page is gener. empir, thi level is a lower bound for reason perform, and easili achiev on stock wintel platform. 3.3 inform sourc the flexibl of the bee"s pheromon infrastructur  permit the integr of numer inform sourc as input to our character of entiti person and predict of their futur behavior. our current system draw on three sourc of inform, but other can readili be ad. real-world observ.-observ from the real world ar encod into the pheromon field each increment of bee time, as a new current page is gener. tabl 1 identifi the entiti that gener each flavor of pheromon. statist estim of threat region.-statist  techniqu1 estim the level of threat to each forc (red or blue), base on the topolog of the battlefield and the known disposit of forc. for exampl, a broad open area with no cover is  threaten, especi if the opposit forc occupi it margin. the result of thi process ar post to the pheromon page as redthreat pheromon (repres a threat to red) and bluethreat pheromon (repres a threat to blue). ai-base plan recognit.-while plan recognit is not suffici for effect predict, it is a valuabl input. we  dynam configur a bay net base on heurist to identifi the like goal that each entiti mai hold.2 the destin of these goal function as virtual pheromon. ghost includ their distanc to such point in their action decis, achiev the  result of gradient follow without the comput expens of maintain a pheromon field. 4. experiment result we have test bee in a seri of experi in which  human wargam make decis that ar plai out in a battlefield simul. the command for each side (red and blue) ha at hi dispos a team of puckster, human oper who set waypoint for individu unit in the simul. each puckster is respons for four to six unit. the simul move the unit, determin fire action, and resolv the outcom of conflict. it is import to emphas that thi simul is simpli a surrog for a sensor feed from a real-world battlefield 4.1 fit disposit to test our abil to fit person base on behavior, on red puckster respons for four unit is design the  emot puckster. he select two of hi unit to be cowardli (chicken) and two to be irrit (rambo). he doe not  disclos thi assign dure the run. he move each unit  accord to the command"s order until the unit encount  circumst that would trigger the emot associ with the unit"s disposit. then he manipul chicken as though thei ar fear (avoid combat and move awai from blue), and move rambo into combat as quickli as possibl. our softwar receiv posit report on all unit, everi twenti second. 1 thi process, known as sad (statist anomali detect), is develop by our colleagu rafael alonso, hua li, and john asmuth at sarnoff corpor. alonso and li ar now at set corpor. 2 thi process, known as kip (knowledg-base intent  project), is develop by our colleagu paul nielsen, jacob crossman, and rich frederiksen at soar technolog. 1430 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) the differ between the two disposit valu  (irrit - cowardic) of the fittest ghost prove a better indic of the emot state of the correspond entiti than either valu by itself. figur 4 show the delta disposit for each of the eight fittest ghost at each time step, plot against the time in second, for a unit plai as a chicken. the valu clearli trend neg. figur 5 show a similar plot for a rambo. rambo tend to die earli, and often do not give their ghost enough time to evolv a clear pictur of their person, but in thi case the posit delta disposit is evid befor the unit"s demis. to character a unit"s person, we maintain a 800-second exponenti weight move averag of the delta disposit, and declar the unit to be a chicken or rambo if thi valu pass a neg or posit threshold, respect. current, thi  threshold is set at 0.25. we ar explor addit filter. for exampl, a rapid rate of increas enhanc the likelihood of call a rambo; unit that seek to avoid detect and avoid combat ar more readili call chicken. tabl 1 show the detect result for emot unit in a recent seri of experi. we never call a rambo a chicken. in the on case where we call a chicken a rambo, log show that in fact the unit wa be plai aggress, rush toward oncom blue forc. the brave die young, so we almost never detect unit plai intention as rambo. figur 6 show a comparison on a separ seri of  experi of our emot detector compar with human. two  coward were plai in each of eleven game. human observ in each game were abl to detect a total of 13 of the coward. bee wa abl to detect coward (= chicken) much earlier than the human, while miss onli on chicken that the human detect. in addit to these result on unit intention plai as emot, bee sometim detect other unit as cowardli or brave. analysi of these unit show that these character were appropri: unit that flee in the face of enemi forc or weapon fire ar detect as chicken, while those that stand their ground or rush the adversari ar denomin as rambo. 4.2 integr predict each ghost that run into the futur gener a possibl path that it unit might follow. the path in the result set over all ghost vari in how like thei ar, the risk thei pose to their own or the opposit side, and so forth. in the experi report here, we select the futur whose ghost receiv the most guidanc from pheromon in the environ at each step along the wai. in thi sens, it is the most like futur. in these experi, we receiv posit report onli on unit that have actual come within visual rang of blue unit, or on averag fewer than half of the live red unit at ani time. we evalu predict spatial, compar an entiti"s  actual locat with the locat predict for it 15 minut earlier. we compar bee with two baselin: a  gametheoret predictor base on linguist geometri [22], and estim by militari offic. in both case, we us a cep (circular error probabl) measur of accuraci, the radiu of the circl that on would have to draw around each predict to

median, whisker extend to the most distant data point within 1.5 of the interquartil rang from the edg of the box, squar show outlier within 3 interquartil rang, and star show more distant outlier. bee"s median score even at 15 minut is lower than either staff median. the wilcoxon test show that the differ between the h15 score is signific at the 99.76% level, while that between the h0 score is signific at more than 99.999%. 5. conclus in mani domain, it is import to reason from an entiti"s observ behavior to an estim of it intern state, and then to extrapol that estim to predict the entiti"s futur behavior. bee perform thi task us a faster-than-real-time simul of swarm agent, coordin through digit pheromon. thi simul integr knowledg of threat region, a cognit analysi of the agent"s belief, desir, and intent, a model of the agent"s emot disposit and state, and the dynam of interact with the environ. by evolv agent in thi rich environ, we can fit their intern state to their observ  behavior. in realist wargam, the system successfulli detect  deliber plai emot and make reason predict about the entiti" futur behavior. bee can onli model intern state variabl that impact the agent"s extern behavior. it cannot fit variabl that the agent doe not manifest extern, sinc the basi for the evolutionari cycl is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simul agent with that of the real entiti. thi limit is seriou if our purpos is to understand the entiti"s intern state for it own sake. if our purpos of fit agent is to predict their subsequ behavior, the limit is much less seriou. state variabl that do not impact behavior, while invis to a behavior-base  analysi, ar irrelev to a behavior predict. the bee architectur lend itself to extens in sever promis direct. the variou input be integr by the bee ar onli an  exampl of the kind of inform that can be handl. the  basic principl of us a dynam simul to integr a wide rang of influenc can be extend to other input as well, requir much less addit engin than other more tradit wai of reason about how differ  knowledg sourc come togeth in impact an agent"s behavior. with such a chang in input, bee could be appli more wide than it current domain of adversari reason in  urban warfar. potenti applic of interest includ comput game, busi strategi, and sensor fusion. our initi limit repertoir of emot is a small subset of those that have been distinguish by psychologist, and that might be us for understand and project behavior. we expect to extend the set of emot and support  disposit that bee can detect. the map between an agent"s psycholog (cognit and emot) state and it outward behavior is not on-to-on. sever differ intern state might be consist with a given observ behavior under on set of environment  condit, but might yield distinct behavior under other condit. if the environ in the recent past is on that confound such distinct intern state, we will be unabl to distinguish them. as long as the environ stai in thi state, our predict will be accur, whichev of the intern state we assign to the agent. if the environ then shift to on under which the differ intern state lead to differ behavior, us the previous chosen intern state will yield inaccur  predict. on wai to address these concern is to probe the real world, perturb it in wai that would stimul distinct  behavior from entiti whose psycholog state is otherwis  indistinguish. such probe is an import intellig  techniqu. bee"s faster-than-real-time simul mai enabl us to identifi appropri probe action, greatli increas
