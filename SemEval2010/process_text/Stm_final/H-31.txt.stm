a studi of poisson queri gener model for inform retriev qiaozhu mei, hui fang, chengxiang zhai depart of comput scienc univers of illinoi at urbana-champaign urbana,il 61801 {qmei2,hfang,czhai}@uiuc.edu abstract mani variant of languag model have been propos for inform retriev. most exist model ar base on multinomi distribut and would score document base on queri likelihood comput base on a queri gener probabilist model. in thi paper, we propos and studi a new famili of queri gener model base on poisson  distribut. we show that while in their simplest form, the new famili of model and the exist multinomi model ar equival, thei behav differ for mani smooth method. we show that the poisson model ha sever  advantag over the multinomi model, includ natur  accommod per-term smooth and allow for more  accur background model. we present sever variant of the new model correspond to differ smooth  method, and evalu them on four repres trec test collect. the result show that while their basic  model perform compar, the poisson model can outperform multinomi model with per-term smooth. the  perform can be further improv with two-stage smooth. categori and subject descriptor: h.3.3  [inform search and retriev]: retriev model gener term: algorithm 1. introduct as a new type of probabilist retriev model, languag model have been shown to be effect for mani retriev task [21, 28, 14, 4]. among mani variant of languag  model propos, the most popular and fundament on is the queri-gener languag model [21, 13], which lead to the queri-likelihood score method for rank document. in such a model, given a queri q and a document d, we  comput the likelihood of gener queri q with a model estim base on document d, i.e., the condit  probabl p(q|d). we can then rank document base on the likelihood of gener the queri. virtual all the exist queri gener languag  model ar base on either multinomi distribut [19, 6, 28] or multivari bernoulli distribut [21, 18]. the  multinomi distribut is especi popular and also shown to be quit effect. the heavi us of multinomi distribut is partli due to the fact that it ha been successfulli us in speech recognit, where multinomi distribut is a  natur choic for model the occurr of a particular word in a particular posit in text. compar with  multivari bernoulli, multinomi distribut ha the advantag of be abl to model the frequenc of term in the queri; in contrast, multivari bernoulli onli model the presenc and absenc of queri term, thu cannot captur differ frequenc of queri term. howev, multivari bernoulli also ha on potenti advantag over multinomi from the viewpoint of retriev: in a multinomi distribut, the probabl of all the term must sum to 1, make it hard to accommod per-term smooth, while in a  multivari bernoulli, the presenc probabl of differ term ar complet independ of each other, easili  accommod per-term smooth and weight. note that term absenc is also indirectli captur in a multinomi model through the constraint that all the term probabl must sum to 1. in thi paper, we propos and studi a new famili of queri gener model base on the poisson distribut. in thi new famili of model, we model the frequenc of each term independ with a poisson distribut. to score a  document, we would first estim a multivari poisson model base on the document, and then score it base on the  likelihood of the queri given by the estim poisson model. in some sens, the poisson model combin the advantag of multinomi in model term frequenc and the advantag of the multivari bernoulli in accommod per-term smooth. inde, similar to the multinomi distribut, the poisson distribut model term frequenc, but  without the constraint that all the term probabl must sum to 1, and similar to multivari bernoulli, it model each term independ, thu can easili accommod per-term smooth. as in the exist work on multinomi languag model, smooth is critic for thi new famili of model. we  deriv sever smooth method for poisson model in parallel to those us for multinomi distribut, and compar the correspond retriev model with those base on  multinomi distribut. we find that while with some  smooth method, the new model and the multinomi model lead to exactli the same formula, with some other  smooth method thei diverg, and the poisson model bring in more flexibl for smooth. in particular, a kei differ is that the poisson model can natur accommod  perterm smooth, which is hard to achiev with a multinomi model without heurist twist of the semant of a  gener model. we exploit thi potenti advantag to develop a new term-depend smooth algorithm for poisson model and show that thi new smooth algorithm can improv perform over term-independ smooth algorithm us either poisson or multinomi model. thi advantag is seen for both on-stage and two-stage smooth. anoth potenti advantag of the poisson model is that it  correspond background model for smooth can be improv through us a mixtur model that ha a close form  formula. thi new background model is shown to outperform the standard background model and reduc the sensit of retriev perform to the smooth paramet. the rest of the paper is organ as follow. in section 2, we introduc the new famili of queri gener model with poisson distribut, and present variou smooth  method which lead to differ retriev function. in section 3, we analyt compar the poisson languag model with the multinomi languag model, from the perspect of  retriev. we then design empir experi to compar the two famili of languag model in section 4. we discuss the relat work in 5 and conclud in 6. 2. queri gener with poisson process in the queri gener framework, a basic assumpt is that a queri is gener with a model estim base on a document. in most exist work [12, 6, 28, 29], peopl assum that each queri word is sampl independ from a multinomi distribut. altern, we assum that a queri is gener by sampl the frequenc of word from a seri of independ poisson process [20]. 2.1 the gener process let v = {w1, ..., wn} be a vocabulari set. let w be a piec of text compos by an author and c(w1), ..., c(wn) be a frequenc vector repres w, where c(wi, w) is the frequenc count of term wi in text w. in retriev, w could be either a queri or a document. we consid the frequenc count of the n uniqu term in w as n differ type of event, sampl from n independ homogen poisson process, respect. suppos t is the time period dure which the author  compos the text. with a homogen poisson process, the frequenc count of each event, i.e., the number of  occurr of wi, follow a poisson distribut with associ paramet λit, where λi is a rate paramet character the expect number of wi in a unit time. the probabl densiti function of such a poisson distribut is given by p(c(wi, w) = k|λit) = e−λit (λit)k k! without lose gener, we set t to the length of the text w (peopl write on word in a unit time), i.e., t = |w|. with n such independ poisson process, each  explain the gener of on term in the vocabulari, the  likelihood of w to be gener from such poisson process can be written as p(w|Λ) = n i=1 p(c(wi, w)|Λ) = n i=1 e−λi·|w| (λi · |w|)c(wi,w) c(wi, w)! where Λ = {λ1, ..., λn} and |w| = n i=1 c(wi, w). we refer to these n independ poisson process with paramet Λ as a poisson languag model. let d = {d1, ..., dm} be an observ set of document  sampl gener from the poisson process abov. the  maximum likelihood estim (mle) of λi is ˆλi = d∈d c(wi, d) d∈d w ∈v c(w , d) note that thi mle is differ from the mle for the  poisson distribut without consid the document length, which appear in [22, 24]. given a document d, we mai estim a poisson languag model Λd us d as a sampl. the likelihood that a queri q is gener from the document languag model Λd can be written as p(q|d) = w∈v p(c(w, q)|Λd) (1) thi represent is clearli differ from the multinomi queri gener model as (1) the likelihood includ all the term in the vocabulari v , instead of onli those appear in q, and (2) instead of the appear of term, the event space of thi model is the frequenc of each term. in practic, we have the flexibl to choos the  vocabulari v . in on extrem, we can us the vocabulari of the whole collect. howev, thi mai bring in nois and  consider comput cost. in the other extrem, we mai focu on the term in the queri and ignor other term, but some us inform mai be lost by ignor the  nonqueri term. as a compromis, we mai conflat all the non-queri term as on singl pseudo term. in other word, we mai assum that there is exactli on non-queri term in the vocabulari for each queri. in our experi, we adopt thi pseudo non-queri term strategi. a document can be score with the likelihood in  equat 1. howev, if a queri term is unseen in the document, the mle of the poisson distribut would assign zero  probabl to the term, caus the probabl of the queri to be zero. as in exist languag model approach, the main challeng of construct a reason retriev model is to find a smooth languag model for p(·|d). 2.2 smooth in poisson retriev model in gener, we want to assign non-zero rate for the queri term that ar not seen in document d. mani smooth method have been propos for multinomi languag  model[2, 28, 29]. in gener, we have to discount the  probabl of some word seen in the text to leav some extra  probabl mass to assign to the unseen word. in poisson  languag model, howev, we do not have the same constraint as in a multinomi model (i.e., w∈v p(w|d) = 1). thu we do not have to discount the probabl of seen word in order to give a non-zero rate to an unseen word. instead, we onli need to guarante that k=0,1,2,... p(c(w, d) = k|d) = 1. in thi section, we introduc three differ strategi to smooth a poisson languag model, and show how thei lead to differ retriev function. 2.2.1 bayesian smooth us gamma prior follow the risk minim framework in [11], we  assum that a document is gener by the arriv of term in a time period of |d| accord to the document languag model, which essenti consist of a vector of poisson rate for each term, i.e., Λd = λd,1, ..., λd,|v | . a document is assum to be gener from a  potenti differ model. given a particular document d, we want to estim Λd. the rate of a term is estim  independ of other term. we us bayesian estim with the follow gamma prior, which ha two paramet, α and β: gamma(λ|α, β) = βα Γ(α) λα−1 e−βλ for each term w, the paramet αw and βw ar chosen to be αw = µ ∗ λc,w and βw = µ, where µ is a paramet and λc,w is the rate of w estim from some background languag model, usual the collect languag model. the posterior distribut of Λd is given by p(Λd|d, c) ∝ w∈v e−λw(|d|+µ) λ c(w,d)+µλc,w−1 w which is a product of |v | gamma distribut with  paramet c(w, d) + µλc,w and |d| + µ for each word w. given that the gamma mean is α β , we have ˆλd,w = λd,w λd,wp(λd,w|d, c)dλd,w = c(w, d) + µλc,w |d| + µ thi is precis the smooth estim of multinomi languag model with dirichlet prior [28]. 2.2.2 interpol (jelinek-mercer) smooth anoth straightforward method is to decompos the queri gener model as a mixtur of two compon model. on is the document languag model estim with  maximum likelihood estim, and the other is a model  estim from the collect background, p(·|c), which assign non-zero rate to w. for exampl, we mai us an interpol coeffici  between 0 and 1 (i.e., δ ∈ [0, 1]). with thi simpl  interpol, we can score a document with score(d, q) = w∈v log((1 − δ)p(c(w, q)|d) + δp(c(w, q)|c)) (2) us the maximum likelihood estim for p(·|d), we have λd,w = c(w,d) |d| , thu equat 2 becom score(d, q) ∝ w∈d∩q [log(1 + 1 − δ δ e−λd,w|q| (λd,w|q|)c(w,q) c(w, q)! · p(c(w, q)|c) ) − log (1 − δ)e−λd,w|q| + δp(c(w, q) = 0|c) 1 − δ + δp(c(w, q) = 0|c) ] + w∈d log (1 − δ)e−λd,w|q| + δp(c(w, q) = 0|c) 1 − δ + δp(c(w, q) = 0|c) we can also us a poisson languag model for p(·|c), or us some other frequenc-base model. in the retriev formula abov, the first summat can be comput effici. the second summat can be actual treat as a document prior, which penal long document. as the second summat is difficult to comput effici, we conflat all non-queri term as on pseudo  non-queryterm, denot as n. us the pseudo-term formul and a poisson collect model, we can rewrit the retriev formula as score(d, q) ∝ w∈d∩q log(1 + 1 − δ δ e−λd,w (λd,w|q|)c(w,q) e−λd,c |q| (λd,c )c(w,q) ) + log (1 − δ)e−λd,n |q| + δe−λc,n |q| 1 − δ + δe−λc,n |q| (3) where λd,n = |d|− w∈q c(w,d) |d| and λc,n = |c|− w∈q c(w,c) |c| . 2.2.3 two-stage smooth as discuss in [29], smooth plai two role in retriev: (1) to improv the estim of the document languag model, and (2) to explain the common term in the queri. in order to distinguish the content and non-discrimin word in a queri, we follow [29] and assum that a queri is gener by sampl from a two-compon mixtur of poisson languag model, with on compon be the document model Λd and the other be a queri background languag model p(·|u). p(·|u) model the typic term frequenc in the user"s queri. we mai then score each document with the queri likelihood comput us the  follow two-stage smooth model: p(c(w, q)|Λd, u) = (1 − δ)p(c(w, q)|Λd) + δp(c(w, q)|u) (4) where δ is a paramet, roughli indic the amount of nois in q. thi look similar to the interpol  smooth, except that p(·|Λd) now should be a smooth languag model, instead of the on estim with mle. with no prior knowledg on p(·|u), we could set it to p(·|c). ani smooth method for the document languag model can be us to estim p(·|d) such as the gamma smooth as discuss in section 2.2.1. the empir studi of the smooth method is  present in section 4. 3. analysi of poisson languag model from the previou section, we notic that the poisson  languag model ha a strong connect to the multinomi  languag model. thi is expect sinc thei both belong to the exponenti famili [26]. howev, there ar mani differ when these two famili of model ar appli with  differ smooth method. from the perspect of retriev, will these two languag model perform equival? if not, which model provid more benefit to retriev, or provid flexibl which could lead to potenti benefit? in thi section, we analyt discuss the retriev featur of the poisson languag model, by compar their behavior with that of the multinomi languag model. 3.1 the equival of basic model let us begin with the assumpt that all the queri term appear in everi document. under thi assumpt, no  smooth is need. a document can be score by the log  likelihood of the queri with the maximum likelihood estim: score(d, q) = w∈v log e−λd,w|q| (λd,w|q|)c(w,q) c(w, q)! (5) us the mle, we have λd,w = c(w,d) w∈v c(w,d) . thu score(d, q) ∝ c(w,q)>0 c(w, q) log c(w, d) w∈v c(w, d) thi is exactli the log likelihood of the queri if the  document languag model is a multinomi with maximum  likelihood estim. inde, even with gamma smooth, when plug λd,w = c(w,d)+µλc,w |d|+µ and λc,w = c(w,c) |c| into  equat 5, it is easi to show that score(d, q) ∝ w∈q∩d c(w, q) log(1 + c(w, d) µ · c(w,c) |c| ) + |q| log µ |d| + µ (6) which is exactli the dirichlet retriev formula in [28]. note that thi equival hold onli when the document length variat is model with poisson process. thi deriv indic the equival of the basic  poisson and multinomi languag model for retriev. with other smooth strategi, howev, the two model would be differ. nevertheless, with thi equival in basic model, we could expect that the poisson languag model perform compar to the multinomi languag model in retriev, if onli simpl smooth is explor. base on thi equival analysi, on mai ask, why we should pursu the poisson languag model. in the follow section, we show that despit the equival in their basic model, the poisson languag model bring in extra flexibl for  explor advanc techniqu on variou retriev featur, which could not be achiev with multinomi languag model. 3.2 term depend smooth on flexibl of the poisson languag model is that it provid a natur framework to accommod term  depend (per-term) smooth. exist work on languag model smooth ha alreadi shown that differ type of queri should be smooth differ accord to how  discrimin the queri term ar. [7] also predict that  differ term should have a differ smooth weight. with multinomi queri gener model, peopl usual us a singl smooth coeffici to control the combin of the document model and the background model [28, 29]. thi paramet can be made specif for differ queri, but alwai ha to be a constant for all the term. thi is mandatori sinc a multinomi languag model ha the constraint that w∈v p(w|d) = 1. howev, from retriev perspect, differ term mai need to be smooth  differ even if thei ar in the same queri. for exampl, a non-discrimin term (e.g., the, is) is expect to be explain more with the background model, while a content term (e.g., retriev, bush) in the queri should be  explain with the document model. therefor, a better wai of smooth would be to set the interpol coeffici (i.e., δ in formula 2 and formula 3) specif for each term. sinc the poisson languag model doe not have the sum-to-on constraint across term, it can easili  accommod per-term smooth without need to heurist twist the semant of a gener model as in the case of multinomi languag model. below we present a  possibl wai to explor term depend smooth with poisson languag model. essenti, we want to us a term-specif smooth  coeffici δ in the linear combin, denot as δw. thi  coeffici should intuit be larger if w is a common word and smaller if it is a content word. the kei problem is to find a method to assign reason valu to δw. empir  tune is infeas for so mani paramet. we mai instead estim the paramet ∆ = {δ1, ..., δ|v |} by  maxim the likelihood of the queri given the mixtur model of p(q|Λq) and p(q|u), where Λq is the true queri model to gener the queri and p(q|u) is a queri background model as discuss in section 2.2.3. with the model p(q|Λq) hidden, the queri likelihood is p(q|∆, u) = Λq w∈v ((1 − δw)p(c(w, q)|Λq) + δwp(c(w, q)|u))p(Λq|u)dΛq if we have relev document for each queri, we can  approxim the queri model space with the languag model of all the relev document. without relev document, we opt to approxim the queri model space with the  model of all the document in the collect. set p(·|u) as p(·|c), the queri likelihood becom p(q|∆, u) = d∈c πd w∈v ((1−δw)p(c(w, q)|ˆΛd)+δwp(c(w, q)|c)) where πd = p(ˆΛd|u). p(·|ˆΛd) is an estim poisson  languag model for document d. if we have prior knowledg on p(ˆΛd|u), such as which  document ar relev to the queri, we can set πd accordingli, becaus what we want is to find ∆ that can maxim the likelihood of the queri given relev document. without thi prior knowledg, we can leav πd as free paramet, and us the em algorithm to estim πd and ∆. the updat function ar given as π (k+1) d = πd w∈v ((1 − δw)p(c(w, q)|ˆΛd) + δwp(c(w, q)|c)) d∈c πd w∈v ((1 − δw)p(c(w, q)|ˆΛd) + δwp(c(w, q)|c)) and δ (k+1) w = d∈c πd δwp(c(w, q)|c)) (1 − δw)p(c(w, q)|ˆΛd) + δwp(c(w, q)|c)) as discuss in [29], we onli need to run the em  algorithm for sever iter, thu the comput cost is rel low. we again assum our vocabulari contain all queri term plu a pseudo non-queri term. note that the function doe not give an explicit wai of estim the  coeffici for the unseen non-queri term. in our experi, we set it to the averag over δw of all queri term. with thi flexibl, we expect poisson languag model could improv the retriev perform, especi for  verbos queri, where the queri term have variou  discrimin valu. in section 4, we us empir experi to prove thi hypothesi. 3.3 mixtur background model anoth flexibl is to explor differ background  (collect) model (i.e., p(·|u), or p(·|c)). on common  assumpt made in languag model inform retriev is that the background model is a homogen model of the document model [28, 29]. similarli, we can also make the assumpt that the collect model is a poisson  languag model, with the rate λc,w = d∈c c(w,d) |c| . howev, thi assumpt usual doe not hold, sinc the collect is far more complex than a singl document. inde, the collect usual consist of a mixtur of document with variou genr, author, and topic, etc. treat the  collect model as a mixtur of document model, instead of a singl pseudo-document model is more reason.  exist work of multinomi languag model ha alreadi shown that a better model of background improv the retriev perform, such as cluster [15, 10], neighbor document [25], and aspect [8, 27]. all the approach can be easili adopt us poisson languag model.  howev, a common problem of these approach is that thei all requir heavi comput to construct the background model. with poisson languag model, we show that it is possibl to model the mixtur background without pai for the heavi comput cost. poisson mixtur [3] ha been propos to model a  collect of document, which can fit the data much better than a singl poisson. the basic idea is to assum that the  collect is gener from a mixtur of poisson model, which ha the gener form of p(x = k|pm) = λ p(λ)p(x = k|λ)dλ p(·|λ) is a singl poisson model and p(λ) is an arbitrari  probabl densiti function. there ar three well known poisson mixtur [3]: 2-poisson, neg binomi, and the katz"s k-mixtur [9]. note that the 2-poisson model ha actual been explor in probabilist retriev model, which led to the well-known bm25 formula [22]. all these mixtur have close form, and can be  estim from the collect of document effici. thi is an advantag over the multinomi mixtur model, such as plsi [8] and lda [1], for retriev. for exampl, the  probabl densiti function of katz"s k-mixtur is given as p(c(w) = k|αw, βw) = (1 − αw)ηk,0 + αw βw + 1 ( βw βw + 1 )k where ηk,0 = 1 when k = 0, and 0 otherwis. with the observ of a collect of document, αw and βw can be estim as βw = cf(w) − df(w) df(w) and αw = cf(w) nβw where cf(w) and df(w) ar the collect frequenc and document frequenc of w, and n is the number of  document in the collect. to account for the differ  document length, we assum that βw is a reason estim for gener a document of the averag length, and us β = βw avdl |q| to gener the queri. thi poisson mixtur model can be easili us to replac p(·|c) in the retriev function 3 and 4. 3.4 other possibl flexibl in addit to term depend smooth and effici mixtur background, a poisson languag model ha also some other potenti advantag. for exampl, in section 2, we see that formula 2 introduc a compon which doe document length penal. intuit, when the  document ha more uniqu word, it will be penal more. on the other hand, if a document is exactli n copi of anoth document, it would not get over penal. thi featur is desir and not achiev with the dirichlet model [5].  potenti, thi compon could penal a document  accord to what type of term it contain. with term specif set of δ, we could get even more flexibl for document length normal. pseudo-feedback is yet anoth interest direct where the poission model might be abl to show it advantag. with model-base feedback, we could again relax the  combin coeffici of the feedback model and the background model, and allow differ term to contribut differ to the feedback model. we could also util the relev document to learn better per-term smooth coeffici. 4. evalu in section 3, we analyt compar the poisson  languag model and multinomi languag model from the perspect of queri gener and retriev. in thi  section, we compar these two famili of model empir. experi result show that the poisson model with  perterm smooth outperform multinomi model, and the perform can be further improv with two-stage  smooth. us poisson mixtur as background model also  improv the retriev perform. 4.1 dataset sinc retriev perform could significantli vari from on test collect to anoth, and from on queri to  anoth, we select four repres trec test collect: ap, trec7, trec8, and wt2g(web). to cover differ type of queri, we follow [28, 5], and construct short-keyword (sk, keyword titl), short-verbos (sv, on sentenc  descript), and long-verbos (lv, multipl sentenc) queri. the document ar stem with the porter"s stemmer, and we do not remov ani stop word. for each paramet, we vari it valu to cover a reason wide rang. 4.2 comparison to multinomi we compar the perform of the poisson retriev  model and multinomi retriev model us interpol  (jelinekmerc, jm) smooth and bayesian smooth with  conjug prior. tabl 1 show that the two jm-smooth model perform similarli on all data set. sinc the dirichlet smooth for multinomi languag model and the gamma smooth for poisson languag model lead to the same  retriev formula, the perform of these two model ar jointli present. we see that dirichlet/gamma smooth method outperform both jelinek-mercer smooth  method. the

in the simpl jelinek-mercer smooth formula (i.e., formula 3), and us the em algorithm propos in section 3.2 to find a δw for each uniqu term. sinc we ar us the em algorithm to iter estim the paramet, we usual do not want the probabl of p(·|d) to be zero. we then us a simpl laplac method to slightli smooth the document model  befor it goe into the em iter. the document ar then still score with

of the jelinek-mercer poisson model is improv in most case. howev, in some case (e.g., trec7/sv), it perform poorli. thi might be caus by the problem of em estim with unsmooth document model. onc non-zero probabl is assign to all the term befor enter the em iter, the perform on verbos queri can be improv  significantli. thi indic that there is still room to find better method to estim δw. pleas note that neither the  perterm jm method nor the jm+l. method ha a paramet to tune. as shown in tabl 1, the term depend two-stage  smooth can significantli improv retriev perform. to  understand whether the improv is contribut by the term depend smooth or the two-stage smooth  framework, we design anoth experi to compar the  perterm two-stage smooth with the two-stage smooth method propos in [29]. their method manag to find coeffici specif to the queri, thu a verbos queri would us a higher δ. howev, sinc their model is base on  multinomi languag model, thei could not get per-term  coeffici. we adopt their method to the poisson two-stage smooth, and also estim a per-queri coeffici for all the term. we compar the perform of such a model with the per-term two-stage smooth model, and present the result in the right two column in tabl 2. again, we see that the per-term two-stage smooth outperform the per-queri two-stage smooth, especi for verbos queri. the improv is not as larg as how the  perterm smooth method improv over dirichlet/gamma. thi is expect, sinc the per-queri smooth ha alreadi address the queri discrimin problem to some extent. thi experi show that even if the smooth is alreadi per-queri, make it per-term is still benefici. in brief, the per-term smooth improv the retriev perform of both on-stage and two-stage smooth method. 4.4 mixtur background model in thi section, we conduct experi to examin the benefit of us a mixtur background model without extra comput cost, which can not be achiev for  multinomi model. specif, in retriev formula 3, instead of us a singl poisson distribut to model the background p(·|c), we us katz"s k-mixtur model, which is essenti a mixtur of poisson distribut. p(·|c) can be comput effici with simpl collect statist, as

the best of our knowledg, there ha been no studi of queri gener model base on poisson distribut. languag model have been shown to be effect for mani retriev task [21, 28, 14, 4]. the most popular and  fundament on is the queri-gener languag model [21, 13]. all exist queri gener languag model ar base on either multinomi distribut [19, 6, 28, 13] or  multivari bernoulli distribut [21, 17, 18]. we introduc a new famili of languag model, base on poisson  distribut. poisson distribut ha been previous studi in the document gener model [16, 22, 3, 24], lead to the develop of on of the most effect retriev formula bm25 [23]. [24] studi the parallel deriv of three  differ retriev model which is relat to our comparison of poisson and multinomi. howev, the poisson model in their paper is still under the document gener  framework, and also doe not account for the document length variat. [26] introduc a wai to empir search for an exponenti model for the document. poisson mixtur [3] such as 2-poisson [22], neg multinomi, and katz"s  kmixtur [9] ha shown to be effect to model and retriev document. onc again, none of thi work explor poisson distribut in the queri gener framework. languag model smooth [2, 28, 29] and background structur [15, 10, 25, 27] have been studi with  multinomi languag model. [7] analyt show that term specif smooth could be us. we show that  poisson languag model is natur to accommod the per-term smooth without heurist twist of the semant of a  gener model, and is abl to effici better model the mixtur background, both analyt and empir. 6. conclus we present a new famili of queri gener languag model for retriev base on poisson distribut. we  deriv sever smooth method for thi famili of model, includ singl-stage smooth and two-stage smooth. we compar the new model with the popular multinomi retriev model both analyt and experiment. our analysi show that while our new model and multinomi model ar equival under some assumpt, thei ar gener differ with some import differ. in  particular, we show that poisson ha an advantag over  multinomi in natur accommod per-term smooth. we exploit thi properti to develop a new per-term smooth algorithm for poisson languag model, which is shown to outperform term-independ smooth for both poisson and multinomi model. furthermor, we show that a  mixtur background model for poisson can be us to improv the perform and robust over the standard poisson background model. our work open up mani interest  direct for further explor in thi new famili of model. further explor the flexibl over multinomi languag model, such as length normal and pseudo-feedback could be good futur work. it is also appeal to find  robust method to learn the per-term smooth coeffici without addit comput cost. 7. acknowledg we thank the anonym sigir 07 review for their us comment. thi materi is base in part upon work support by the nation scienc foundat under award number ii-0347933 and 0425852. 8. refer [1] d. blei, a. ng, and m. jordan. latent dirichlet alloc. journal of machin learn research, 3:993-1022, 2003.
