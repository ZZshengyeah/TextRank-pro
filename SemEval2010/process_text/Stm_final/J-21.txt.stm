a strateg model for inform market evdokia nikolova∗ mit csail cambridg, ma nikolova @mit.edu rahul sami univers of michigan school of inform rsami @umich.edu abstract inform market, which ar design specif to  aggreg trader" inform, ar becom increasingli  popular as a mean for predict futur event. recent  research in inform market ha result in two new  design, market score rule and dynam parimutuel  market. we develop an analyt method to guid the design and strateg analysi of inform market. our central contribut is a new abstract bet game, the project game, that serv as a us model for inform  market. we demonstr that thi game can serv as a strateg model of dynam parimutuel market, and also captur the essenc of the strategi in market score rule. the  project game is tractabl to analyz, and ha an attract geometr visual that make the strateg move and interact more transpar. we us it to prove sever strateg properti about the dynam parimutuel market. we also prove that a special form of the project game is strateg equival to the spheric score rule, and it is strateg similar to other score rule. final, we  illustr two applic of the model to analysi of complex strateg scenario: we analyz the precis of a market in which trader have inertia, and a market in which a trader can profit by manipul anoth trader"s belief. categori and subject descriptor j.4 [comput applic]: social and behavior  scienc-econom gener term econom, theori 1. introduct market have long been us as a medium for trade. as a side effect of trade, the particip in a market reveal someth about their prefer and belief. for exampl, in a financi market, agent would bui share which thei think ar undervalu, and sell share which thei think ar overvalu. it ha long been observ that, becaus the market price is influenc by all the trade take place, it aggreg the privat inform of all the trader. thu, in a situat in which futur event ar uncertain, and each trader might have a littl inform, the aggreg  inform contain in the market price can be us to predict futur event. thi ha motiv the creation of inform market, which ar mechan for aggreg the trader" inform about an uncertain event. inform market can be model as a game in which the particip bet on a number of possibl outcom, such as the result of a presidenti elect, by bui share of the outcom and receiv payoff when the outcom is realiz. as in financi market, the particip aim to maxim their profit by bui low and sell high. in thi wai, the player" behavior transmit their person  inform and belief about the possibl outcom, and can be us to predict the event more accur. the benefit of well-design inform market goe beyond inform aggreg; thei can also be us as a hedg instrument, to allow trader to insur against risk. recent, research have turn to the problem of  design market structur specif to achiev better  inform aggreg properti than tradit market. two design for inform market have been propos: the dynam parimutuel market (dpm) by pennock [10] and the market score rule (msr) by hanson [6]. both the dpm and the msr were design with the goal of give inform trader an incent to trade, and to reveal their inform as soon as possibl, while also control the subsidi that the market design need to pump into the market. the dpm wa creat as a combin of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonli us for bet on hors) and a continu doubl auction, in order to simultan obtain the first on"s infinit bui-in liquid and the latter"s  abil to react continu to new inform. on version of the dpm wa implement in the yahoo! buzz market [8] to experiment test the market"s predict  properti. the foundat of the msr lie in the idea of a proper score rule, which is a techniqu to reward forecast in a wai that encourag them to give their best predict. 316 the innov in the msr is to us these score rule as instrument that can be trade, thu provid trader who have new inform an incent to trade. the msr wa to be us in a polici analysi market in the middl east [15], which wa subsequ withdrawn. inform market reli on inform trader trade for their own profit, so it is critic to understand the strateg properti of these market. thi is not an easi task,  becaus market ar complex, and trader can influenc each other"s belief through their trade, and henc, can  potenti achiev long term gain by manipul the market. for the msr, it ha been shown that, if we exclud the  possibl of achiev gain through mislead other trader, it is optim for each trader to honestli reflect her privat belief in her trade. for the dpm, we ar not awar of ani prior strateg analysi of thi natur; in fact, a strateg hole wa discov while test the dpm in the yahoo! buzz market [8]. 1.1 our result in thi paper, we seek to develop an analyt method to guid the design and strateg analysi of inform  market. our central contribut is a new abstract bet game, the project 1 game, that serv as a us model for inform market. the project game is  conceptu simpler than the msr and dpm, and thu it is easier to analyz. in addit it ha an attract geometr  visual, which make the strateg move and interact more transpar. we present an analysi of the optim strategi and profit in thi game. we then undertak an analysi of trader" cost and  profit in the dynam parimutuel market. remark, we find that the cost of a sequenc of trade in the dpm is  ident to the cost of the correspond move in the project game. further, if we assum that the trader belief at the end of trade match the true probabl of the event be predict, the trader" payoff and profit in the dpm ar ident to their payoff and profit in a correspond  project game. we us the equival between the dpm and the project game to prove that the dpm is arbitrag-free, deduc profit strategi in the dpm, and demonstr that constraint on the agent" trade ar necessari to  prevent a strateg breakdown. we also prove an equival between the project game and the msr: we show that plai in the msr is strateg equival to plai in a restrict project game, at least for myopic strategi and small trade. in particular, the profit of ani move under the spheric score rule is exactli proport to the profit of the correspond move in the project game restrict to a circl, with slight distort of the prior probabl. thi allow us to us the project game as a conceptu model for market score rule. we note that while the msr with the spheric score rule somewhat resembl the project game, due to the mathemat similar of their profit express, the dpm model is markedli differ and thu it equival to the project game is especi strike. further, becaus the restrict project game correspond to a dpm with a natur trade constraint, thi shed light on an intrigu connect between the msr and the dpm. 1 in an earlier version of thi paper, we call thi the  segment game. lastli, we illustr how the project game model can be us to analyz the potenti for manipul of  inform market for long-term gain.2 we present an exampl scenario in which such manipul can occur, and suggest addit rule that might mitig the possibl of  manipul. we also illustr anoth applic to analyz how a market maker can improv the predict accuraci of a market in which trader will not trade unless their  expect profit is abov a threshold. 1.2 relat work numer studi have demonstr empir that  market price ar good predictor of futur event, and seem to aggreg the collect wisdom of all the trader [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16]. thi effect ha also been demonstr in laboratori studi [13, 14], and ha theoret support in the literatur of ration expect [9]. a number of recent studi have address the design of the market structur and trade rule for inform  market, as well as the incent to particip and other  strateg issu. the two paper most close relat to our work ar the paper by hanson [6] and pennock [10]. howev, strateg issu in inform market have also been  studi by mangold et al. [8] and by hanson, oprea and porter [7]. an upcom survei paper [11] discuss  costfunct formul of autom market maker. organ of the paper the rest of thi paper is organ as follow: in section 2, we describ the  project game, and analyz the player" cost, profit, and  optim strategi in thi game. in section 3, we studi the dynam parimutuel market, and show that trade in a dpm is equival to a project game. we establish a  connect between the project game and the msr in section 4. in section 5, we illustr how the project game can be us to analyz non-myopic, and potenti manipul, action. we present our conclus, and suggest for futur work, in section 6. 2. the project game in thi section, we describ an abstract bet game, the project game; in the follow section, we will argu that both the msr and the dpm ar strateg similar to the project game. the project game is conceptu simpler than msr and dpm, and henc should prove easier to analyz. for clariti of exposit, here and in the rest of the paper we assum the space is two dimension, i.e., there ar onli two possibl event. our result easili gener to more than two dimens. we also assum throughout that player ar risk-neutral. suppos there ar two mutual exclus and exhaust event, a and b. (in other word, b is the same as not a.) there ar n agent who mai have inform about the likelihood of a and b, and we (the design) would like to aggreg their inform. we invit them to plai the game describ below: at ani point in the game, there is a current state  describ by a pair of paramet, (x, y), which we sometim write in vector form as x. intuit, x correspond to the 2 here, we ar refer onli to manipul of the  inform market for later gain from the market itself; we do not consid the possibl of trader have vest interest in the underli event. 317 total hold of share in a, and y correspond to the  hold of share in b. in each move of the game, on player (sai i) plai an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ). we us the notat [(x, y) → (x , y )] or [x, x ] to  denot thi move. the game start at (0, 0), but the market maker make the first move; without loss of gener, we can assum the move is to (1, 1). all subsequ move ar made by player, in an arbitrari (and potenti repeat) sequenc. each move ha a cost associ with it, given by c[x, x ] = |x | − |x|, where | · | denot the euclidean norm, |x| = p x2 + y2. note that none of the variabl ar constrain to be  nonneg, and henc, the cost of a move can be neg. the cost can be express in an altern form, that is also us. suppos player i move from (x, y) to (x , y ). we can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + lei), such that l ≥ 0 and |ex|2 + |ey|2 = 1. we call l the volum of the move, and (ex, ey) the direct of the move. at ani point (ˆx, ˆy), there is an instantan price charg, defin as follow: c((ˆx, ˆy), (ex, ey)) = ˆxex + ˆyei |(ˆx, ˆy)| = ˆx · e |ˆx| . note that the price depend onli on the angl between the line join the vector (ˆx, ˆy) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )], and not the length. the total cost of the move is the price integr over the segment [(x, y) → (x , y )], i.e., c[(x, y) → (x , y )] = z l w=0 c((x+wex, y +wei), (ex, ey))dw we assum that the game termin after a finit number of move. at the end of the game, the true probabl p of event a is determin, and the agent receiv payoff for the move thei made. let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1−p) |(p,1−p)| . the payoff to agent i for a segment [(x, y) → (x , y )] is given by: p([(x, y) → (x , y )]) = qx(x − x) + qy(y − y) = q.(x − x) we call the line through the origin with slope (1 − p)/p = qy/qx the p-line. note that the payoff, too, mai be neg. on drawback of the definit of a project game is that implement the payoff requir us to know the  actual probabl p. thi is feasibl if the probabl can eventu be determin statist, such as when  predict the rel frequenc of differ recur event, or vote share. it is also feasibl for on-off event in which there is reason to believ that the true probabl is either 0 or 1. for other on-off event, it cannot be implement directli (unlik score rule, which can be implement in expect). howev, we believ that even in these case, the project game can be us as a conceptu and  analyt tool. the move, cost and payoff have a natur geometr represent, which is shown in figur 1 for three  player with on move each. the player append direct line segment in turn, and the payoff player i final receiv for a move is the project of her segment onto the line with slope (1 − p)/p. her cost is the differ of distanc of the endpoint of her move to the origin. 2.1 strategicproperti oftheprojectiongam we begin our strateg analysi of the project game by observ the follow simpl path-independ properti. 1−p p 3"s m ov 1"s payoff m m m ov 1"s move 2"smove 3"s payoff 2"s payoff x y figur 1: a project game with three player lemma 1. [path-independ] suppos there is a sequenc of move lead from (x, y) to (x , y ). then, the total cost of all the move is equal to the cost of the singl move [(x, y) → (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the move is equal to the payoff of the singl move [(x, y) → (x , y )]. proof. the proof follow trivial from the definit of the cost and payoff: if we consid a path from point x to point x , both the net chang in the vector length and the net project onto the p-line ar complet determin by x and x . although simpl, path independ of profit is vital import, becaus it impli (and is impli by) the  absenc of arbitrag in the market. in other word, there is no sequenc of move that start and end at the same point, but result in a posit profit. on the other hand, if there were two path from (x, y) to (x , y ) with differ profit, there would be a cyclic path with posit profit. for eas of refer, we summar some more us properti of the cost and payoff function in the project game. lemma 2. 1. the instantan price for move along a line through the origin is 1 or −1, when the move is awai or toward the origin respect. the instantan price along a circl center at the origin is 0. 2. when x move along a circl center at the origin to point ¯x on the posit p-line, the correspond payoff is p(x, ¯x) = |x| − x · q, and the cost is c[x, ¯x] = 0. 3. the two cost function formul ar equival: c[x, x ] = z l w=0 co(x + we, e)dw = |x |−|x| ∀x, x , where e is the unit vector give the direct of move. in addit, when x move along the posit p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, p(x, x ) = |x | − |x|. proof. 1. the instantan price is c(x, e) = x · e/|x| = co(x, e), where e is the direct of movement, and the result follow. 2. sinc ¯x is on the posit p-line, q·¯x = |¯x| = |x|, henc p(x, ¯x) = q · (¯x − x) = |x| − x · q; the cost is 0 from the definit. 318 3. from part 1, the cost of move from x to the origin is c[x, 0] = z l w=0 co(x + we, e)dw = z l w=0 (−1)dw = −|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|. by the path-independ properti, c[x, x ] = c[x, 0] + c[0, x ] = |x | − |x|. final, a point on the posit p-line get project to itself, name q · x = |x| so when the movement is along the posit p-line, p(x, x ) = q · (x − x) = |x | − |x| = c[x, x ]. we now consid the question of which move ar  profit in thi game. the eventu profit of a move [x, x ], where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is profit[x, x ] = p[x, x ] − c[x, x ] = lq.e − c[x, x ] differenti with respect to l, we get d(profit) dl = q.e − c(x + le, e) = q.e − x + le |x + le| .e we observ that thi is 0 if p(y + lei) = (1 − p)(x + lex), in other word, when the vector q and (x + le) ar exactli align. further, we observ that the price is non-decreas with increas l. thu, along the direct e, the profit is maxim at the point of intersect with the p-line. by lemma 2, there is alwai a path from x to the posit p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circl with center at the origin and radiu |x|. also, ani movement along the p-line ha 0 addit profit. thu, for ani point x, we can defin the profit potenti φ(x, p) by φ(x, p) = |x| − x · q. note, the potenti is posit for x off the posit p-line and zero for x on the line. next we show that a move to a lower potenti is alwai profit. lemma 3. the profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the  differ in potenti φ(x, p) − φ(x , p). proof. denot z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these ar the point of intersect of the posit p-line with the  circl center at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respect. by the path-independ properti and lemma 2, the profit of move [x, x ] is profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x ) = (|x| − x · q) + 0 + (x · q − |x |) = φ(x, p) − φ(x , p). thu, the profit of the move is equal to the chang in profit potenti between the endpoint. thi lemma offer anoth wai of see that it is optim to move to the point of lowest potenti, name to the p-line. p y 1−p x x x" z z" profit = |x|−x.q profit = x".q−|x"| profit = 0 figur 2: the profit of move [x, x ] is equal to the chang in profit potenti from x to x . 3. dynam parimutuel market the dynam parimutuel market (dpm) wa introduc by pennock [10] as an inform market structur that  encourag inform trader to trade earli, ha guarante  liquid, and requir a bound subsidi. thi market  structur wa us in the yahoo! buzz market [8]. in thi  section, we show that the dynam parimutuel market is also remark similar to the project game. coupl with section 4, thi also demonstr a strong connect  between the dpm and msr. in a two-event dpm, user can place bet on either event a or b at ani time, by bui a share in the appropri event. the price of a share is variabl, determin by the total amount of monei in the market and the number of share current outstand. further, exist share can be sold at the current price. after it is determin which event realli happen, the share ar liquid for cash. in the total-monei-redistribut variant of dpm, which is the variant us in the yahoo! market, the total monei is divid equal among the share of the win event; share of the lose event ar worthless. note that the  payoff ar undefin if the event ha zero outstand share; the dpm rule should preclud thi possibl. we us the follow notat: let x be the number of outstand share of a (total over all trader), and y be the number of outstand share in b. let m denot the total monei current in the market. let ca and cb denot the price of share in a and b respect. the price of a share in the yahoo! dpm is determin by the share-ratio principl: ca cb = x y (1) the form of the price can be fulli determin by  stipul that, for ani given valu of m, x, and y, there must be some probabl pa such that, if a trader believ that pa is the probabl that a will occur and the market will liquid in the current state, she cannot expect to profit from either bui or sell either share. thi give us ca = pa hm x i cb = pb hm y i 319 sinc pa + pb = 1, we have: xca + ycb = m (2) final, combin equat 1 and 2, we get ca = x m x2 + y2 cb = y m x2 + y2 cost of a trade in the dpm consid a trader who come to a dpm in state (m, x, y), and bui or sell share such that the eventu state is (m , x , y ). what is the net cost, m − m, of her move? theorem 4. the cost of the move from (x, y) to (x , y ) is m − m = m0[ p x 2 + y 2 − p x2 + y2] for some constant m0. in other word, it is a constant  multipl of the correspond cost in the project game. proof. consid the function g(x, y) = m0[ p x2 + y2]. the function g is differenti for all x, y = 0, and it"s partial deriv ar: ∂g ∂x = m0[ x p x2 + y2 ] = x g(x, y) x2 + y2 ∂g ∂y = m0[ y p x2 + y2 ] = y g(x, y) x2 + y2 now, compar these equat to the price in the dpm, and observ that, as a trader bui or sell in the dpm, the instantan price is the deriv of the monei. it follow that, if at ani point of time the dpm is in a state (m, x, y) such that m = g(x, y), then, at all subsequ point of time, the state (m , x , y ) of the dpm will satisfi m = g(x , y ). final, note that we can pick the constant m0 such that the equat is satisfi for the initi state of the dpm, and henc, it will alwai be satisfi. on import consequ of theorem 4 is that the  dynam parimutuel market is arbitrag-free (us lemma 1). it is interest to note that the origin yahoo! buzz market us a differ price rule, which did permit arbitrag; the price rule wa chang to the share-ratio rule after trader start exploit the arbitrag opportun [8]. anoth somewhat surpris consequ is that the number of  outstand share x, y complet determin the total  capit m of the dpm. constraint in the dpm although it might seem, base on the cost, that ani move in the project game ha an equival move in the dpm, the dpm place some  constraint on trade. firstli, no trader is allow to have a net neg hold in either share. thi is import,  becaus it ensur that the total hold in each share ar alwai posit. howev, thi is a boundari constraint, and doe not impact the strateg choic for a player with a suffici larg posit hold in each share. thu, we can ignor thi constraint from a first-order strateg  analysi of the dpm. secondli, for practic reason a dpm will probabl have a minimum unit of trade, but we assum here that arbitrarili small quantiti can be trade. payoff in the dpm at some point, trade in the dpm ceas and share ar liquid. we assum here that the true probabl becom known at liquid time, and  describ the payoff in term of the probabl; howev, if the probabl is not reveal, onli the event that actual  occur, these payoff can be implement in expect.  suppos the dpm termin in a state (m, x, y), and the true probabl of event a is p. when the dynam parimutuel market is liquid, the share ar paid off in the  follow wai: each owner of a share of a receiv pm x , and each owner of a share of b receiv (1 − p)m y , for each share own. the payoff in the dpm, although given by a fairli  simpl form, ar conceptu complex, becaus the payoff of a move depend on the subsequ move befor the  market liquid. thu, a fulli ration choic of move in the dpm for player i should take into account the action of subsequ player, includ player i himself. here, we restrict the analysi to myopic, infinitesim  strategi: given the market posit is (m, x, y), in which  direct should a player make an infinitesim move in order to maxim her profit? we show that the infinitesim payoff and profit of a dpm with true probabl p correspond strateg to the infinitesim payoff and profit of a  project game with odd p p/(1 − p), in the follow sens: lemma 5. suppos player i is about to make a move in a dynam parimutuel market in a state (m, x, y), and the true probabl of event a is p. then, assum the market is liquid after i"s move, • if x y < q p 1−p , player i profit by bui share in a , or sell share in b. • if x y > q p 1−p , player i profit by sell share in a, or bui share in b. proof. consid the cost and payoff of bui a small quantiti Δx of share in a. the cost is c[(x, y) → (x + Δx, y)] = Δx · x m x2+y2 , and the payoff is Δx · pm x . thu, bui the share is profit iff Δx · x m x2 + y2 < Δx · p m x ⇔ x2 x2 + y2 < p ⇔ x2 + y2 x2 > 1 p ⇔ 1 + ( y x )2 > 1 p ⇔ y x > r 1 − p p ⇔ x y < r p 1 − p thu, bui a is profit if x y < q p 1−p , and sell a is profit if x y > q p 1−p . the analysi for bui or sell b is similar, with p and (1 − p) interchang. it follow from lemma 5 that it is myopic profit for player to move toward the line with slope q 1−p p . note that there is a on-to-on map between 1−p p and q 1−p p 320 in their respect rang, so thi line is uniqu defin, and each such line also correspond to a uniqu p.  howev, becaus the actual payoff of a move depend on the  futur move, player must base their decis on some belief about the final state of the market. in the light of lemma 5, on natur, ration-expect style assumpt is that the final state (m, x∗ , y∗ ) will satisfi x∗ y∗ = q p 1−p . (in other word, on might assum that the trader" belief will  ultim converg to the true probabl p; know p, the trader will drive the market state to satisfi x y = q p 1−p .) thi is veri plausibl in market (such as the yahoo! buzz market) in which trade is permit right until the market is liquid, at which point there is no remain  uncertainti about the relev frequenc. under thi  assumpt, we can prove an even tighter connect between  payoff in the dpm (where the true probabl is p) and payoff in the project game, with odd q p 1−p : theorem 6. suppos that the dpm ultim termin in a state (m, x, y ) satisfi x y = q p 1−p . assum  without loss of gener that the constant m0 = 1, so m =√ x2 + y 2. then, the final payoff for ani move [x → x ] made in the cours of trade is (x − x) · ( √ p, √ 1 − p), i.e., it is the same as the payoff in the project game with oddsq p 1−p . proof. first, observ that x m = √ p and y m = √ 1 − p. the final payoff is the liquid valu of (x − x) share of a and (y − y) share of b, which is payoffdp m [x − x] = p m x (x − x) + (1 − p) m y (y − y) = p 1 √ p (x − x) + (1 − p) 1 √ 1 − p (y − y) = √ p(x − x) + p 1 − p(y − y). strateg analysi for the dpm theorem 4 and 6 give us a veri strong equival between the project game and the dynam parimutuel market, under the  assumpt that the dpm converg to the optim valu for the true probabl. a player plai in a dpm with true odd p/(1 − p), can imagin himself plai in the  project game with odd q p 1−p , becaus both the cost and the payoff of ani given move ar ident. us thi equival, we can transfer all the strateg properti proven for the project game directli to the analysi of the dynam parimutuel market. on  particularli interest conclus we can draw is as follow: in the absenc of ani constraint that disallow it, it is alwai profit for an agent to move toward the origin, by sell share in both a and b while maintain the ratio x/y. in the dpm, thi is limit by forbid short sale, so  player can never have neg hold in either share. as a result, when their hold in on share (sai a) is 0, thei can"t us the strategi of move toward the origin. we can conclud that a ration player should never hold share of both a and b simultan, regardless of her belief and the market posit. thi discuss lead us to consid a modifi dpm, in which thi strateg loophol is address directli: instead of disallow all short sale, we place a constraint that no agent ever reduc the total market capit m (or,  altern, that ani agent"s total invest in the market is alwai non-neg). we call thi the nondecreas market capit constraint for the dpm. thi  correspond to a restrict that no move in the project game reduc the radiu. howev, we can conclud from the  preced discuss that player have no incent to ever  increas the radiu. thu, the move of the project game would all lie on the quarter circl in the posit quadrant, with radiu determin by the market maker"s move. in section 4, we show that the project game on thi  quarter circl is strateg equival (at least myopic) to trade in a market score rule. thu, the dpm and msr appear to be deepli connect to each other, like differ interfac to the same underli game. 4. market score rule the market score rule (msr) wa introduc by  hanson [6]. it is base on the concept of a proper score rule, a techniqu which reward forecast to give their best  predict. hanson"s innov wa to turn the score rule into instrument that can be trade, therebi provid trader who have new inform an incent to trade. on  posit effect of thi design is that a singl trader would still have incent to trade, which is equival to updat the score rule report to reflect her inform, therebi  elimin the problem of thin market and illiquid. in thi section, we show that, when the score rule us is the spheric score rule [4], there is a strong strateg  equival between the project game and the market score rule. proper score rule ar tool us to reward forecast who predict the probabl distribut of an event. we describ thi in the simpl set of two exhaust,  mutual exclus event a and b. in the simpl set of two exhaust, mutual exclus event a and b, proper score rule ar defin as follow. suppos the forecast predict that the probabl of the event ar r = (ra, rb), with ra + rb = 1. the score rule is specifi by function sa(ra, rb) and sb(ra, rb), which ar appli as follow: if the event a occur, the forecast is paid sa(ra, rb), and if the event b occur, the forecast is paid sb(ra, rb). the kei properti that a proper score rule satisfi is that the expect payment is maxim when the report is ident to the true probabl distribut. 4.1 equival with spheric score rule in thi section, we focu on on specif score rule: the spheric score rule [4]. definit 1. the spheric score rule [4] is defin by si(r) def = ri/||r||. for two event, thi can be written as: sa(ra, rb) = ra p r2 a + r2 b ; sb(ra, rb) = rb p r2 a + r2 b the spheric score rule is known to be a proper score rule. the definit gener natur to higher  dimens. we now demonstr a close connect between the  project game restrict to a circular arc and a market score rule that us the spheric score rule. at thi point, it is 321 conveni to us vector notat. let x = (x, y) denot a posit in the project game. we consid the project game restrict to the circl |x| = 1. restrict project game consid a move in thi restrict project game from x to x . recal that q = ( p √ p2+(1−p)2 , 1−p √ p2+(1−p)2 ), where p is the true probabl of the event. then, the project game profit of a move [x, x ] is q · [x − x] (note that |x| = |x |). we can extend thi to an arbitrari collect3 of (not necessarili contigu) move x = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], · · · , [xl, xl]}. seg-profitp(x ) = x [x,x ]∈x q · [x − x] = q · 2 4 x [x,x ]∈x [x − x] 3 5 spheric score rule profit we now turn our  attent to the msr with the spheric score rule (ssr).  consid a player who chang the report from r to r . then, if the true probabl of a is p, her expect profit is ssr-profit([r, r ]) = p(sa(r )−sa(r))+(1−p)(sb(r )−sb(r)) now, let us repres the initi and final posit in term of circular coordin. for r = (ra, rb), defin the  correspond coordin x = ( ra√ r2 a+r2 b , rb√ r2 a+r2 b ). note that the coordin satisfi |x| = 1, and thu correspond to valid coordin for the restrict project game. now, let p denot the vector [p, 1 − p]. then,  expand the spheric score function sa, sb, the player"s profit for a move from r to r can be rewritten in term of the correspond coordin x, x as: ssr-profit([x, x ]) = p · (x − x) for ani collect x of move, the total payoff in the ssr market is given by: ssr-profitp(x ) = x [x,x ]∈x p · [x − x] = p · 2 4 x [x,x ]∈x [x − x] 3 5 final, we note that p and q ar relat by q = μpp, where μp = 1/ p p2 + (1 − p)2 is a scalar that depend onli on p. thi immedi give us the follow strong  strateg equival for the restrict project game and the ssr market: theorem 7. ani collect of move x yield a  posit (neg) payoff in the restrict project game iff x yield a posit (neg) payoff in the spheric score rule market. proof. as deriv abov, seg-profitp(x ) = μpssr-profitp(x ). for all p, 1 ≤ μp ≤ √ 2, (or more gener for an  ndimension probabl vector p, 1 ≤ μp = 1 |p| ≤ √ n, by the arithmet mean-root mean squar inequ), and the result follow immedi. 3 we allow the collect to contain repeat move, i.e., it is a multiset. although theorem 7 is state in term of the sign of the payoff, it extend to rel payoff of two collect of move: corollari 8. consid ani two collect of move x , x . then, x yield a greater payoff than x in the project game iff x yield a greater payment than x in the ssr market. proof. everi move [x, x ] ha a correspond invers move [x , x]. in both the project game and the ssr, the invers move profit is simpli the neg profit of the move (the move ar revers). we can defin a collect of move x = x − x by ad the invers of x to x . note that seg-profitp(x ) = seg-profitp(x )−seg-profitp(x ) and ssr-profitp(x ) = ssr-profitp(x )−ssr-profitp(x ); appli theorem 7 complet the proof. it follow that the ex post optim of a move (or set of move) is the same in both the project game and the ssr market. on it own, thi strong ex post equival is not complet satisfi, becaus in ani non-trivial game there is uncertainti about the valu of p, and the differ scale ratio for differ p could lead to differ ex ant optim behavior. we can extend the correspond to set with uncertain p, as follow: theorem 9. consid the restrict project game with some prior probabl distribut f over possibl valu of p. then, there is a probabl distribut g with the same support as f, and a strictli posit constant c that depend onli on f such that: • (i) for ani collect x of move, the expect profit ar relat by: ef (seg-profit(x )) = ceg(ssr-profit(x )) • (ii) for ani collect x , and ani measur  inform set i ⊆ [0, 1], the expect profit condit on know that p ∈ i satisfi ef (seg-profit(x )|p ∈ i) = ceg(ssr-profit(x )|p ∈ i) the convers also hold: for ani probabl distribut g, there is a distribut f such that both these statement ar true. proof. for simplic, assum that f ha a densiti  function f. (the result hold even for non-continu  distribut). then, let c = r 1 0 μpf(p)dp. defin the densiti function g of distribut g by g(p) = μpf(p) c now, for a collect of move x , ef (seg-profit(x )) = z seg-profitp(x )f(p)dp = z ssr-profitp(x )μpf(p)dp = z ssr-profitp(x )cg(p)dp = ceg(ssr-profit(x )) 322 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x y log score rule quadrat score rule figur 3: sampl score curv for the log score rule si(r) = ai + b log ri and the quadrat score rule si(r) = ai + b(2ri − p k r2 k). to prove part (ii), we simpli restrict the integr to valu in i. the convers follow similarli by construct f from g. analysi of msr strategi theorem 9 provid the foundat for analysi of strategi in score rule market. to the extent that strategi in these market ar  independ of the specif score rule us, we can us the  spheric score rule as the market instrument. then, analysi of strategi in the project game with a slightli distort distribut over p can be us to understand the strateg properti of the origin market situat. implement in expect anoth import consequ of theorem 9 is that the restrict project game can be implement with a small distort in the probabl distribut over valu of p, by us a spheric score rule to implement the payoff. thi make the  project game valuabl as a design tool; for exampl, we can analyz new constraint and rule in the project game, and then implement them via the ssr. unfortun, the result doe not extend to unrestrict project game,  becaus the rel profit of move along the circl versu chang radiu is not preserv through thi  transform. howev, it is possibl to extend the transform to project game in which the radiu ri after the ith move is a fix function of i (not necessarili constant), so that it is not within the strateg control of the player make the move; such game can also be strateg implement via the spheric score rule (with distort of prior). 4.2 connect to other score rule in thi section, we show a weaker similar between the project game and the msr with other score rule. we prove an infinitesim similar between the restrict  project game and the msr with log score rule; the result gener to all proper score rule that have a uniqu local and global maximum. a geometr visual of some common score rule in two dimens is depict in figur 3. the score curv in the figur ar defin by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 − r), r ∈ [0, 1]}. similarli to the project game, defin the profit potenti of a probabl r in msr to be the chang in profit for move from r to the optimum p, φmsr(s(r), p) = profitmsr[s(r), s(p)]. we will show that the profit  potenti in the two game have analog role for analyz the optim strategi, in particular both potenti function have a global minimum 0 at r = p. theorem 10. consid the project game restrict to the non-neg unit circl where strategi x have the  natur on-to-on correspond to probabl distribut r = (r, 1 − r) given by x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ). trade in a log market score rule is strateg similar to trade in the project game on the quarter-circl, in that d dr φ(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr φ(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the project game and msr potenti φ(.). proof. (sketch) the deriv of the msr potenti is d dr φ(s(r), p) = −p · d dr s(r) = − x i pisi(r). for the log score rule si(r) = ai + b log ri with b > 0, d dr φmsr(s(r), p) = −p · b r , − b 1 − r  = −b p r − 1 − p 1 − r  = b r − p r(1 − r) . sinc r = (r, 1 − r) is a probabl distribut, thi  express is posit for r > p and neg for r < p as desir. now, consid the project game on the non-neg unit circl. the potenti for ani x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ) is given by φ(x(r), p) = |x| − q · x(r), it is easi to show that d dr φ(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the deriv is posit for r > p, so the potenti function along the circl is decreas and then increas with r similarli to an energi function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desir. theorem 10 establish that the market log-score rule is strateg similar to the project game plai on a circl, in the sens that the optim direct of movement at the current state is the same in both game. for exampl, if the current state is r < p, it is profit to move to r+dr sinc the effect profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = φ(s(r), p) − φ(s(r + dr), p) > 0. although state for  logscor rule, the theorem hold for ani score rule that induc a potenti with a uniqu local and global minimum at p, such as the quadrat score rule and other. 5. us theproject-gamemodel the chief advantag of the project game ar that it is analyt tractabl, and also easi to visual. in  section 3, we us the project-game model of the dpm to prove the absenc of arbitrag, and to infer strateg  properti that might have been difficult to deduc otherwis. in thi section, we provid two exampl that illustr the power of project-game analysi for gain insight about more complex strateg set. 323 5.1 trader with inertia the standard analysi of the trader behavior in ani of the market form we have studi assert that trader who  disagre with the market probabl will expect to gain from chang the probabl, and thu have a strict incent to trade in the market. the expect gain mai, howev, be veri small. a plausibl model of real trader behavior might includ some form of inertia or -optim: we assum that trader will trade if their expect profit is greater than some constant . we do not attempt to justifi thi model here; rather, we illustr how the project game mai be us to analyz such situat, and shed some light on how to modifi the trade rule to allevi thi problem. consid the simpl project game restrict to a  circular arc with unit radiu; as we have seen, thi  correspond close to the spheric market score rule, and to the dynam parimutuel market under a reason  constraint. now, suppos the market probabl is p, and a trader believ the true probabl is p . then, hi expect gain can be calcul, as follow: let q and q be the unit vector in the direct of p and p respect. the  expect profit is given by e = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q . thu, the trader will trade onli if 1−q·q > . if we let θ and θ be the angl of the p-line and p -line respect (from the x-axi), we get e = 1 − co(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a taylor seri approxim give us that e ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2. thu, we can deriv a bound on the limit of the market accuraci: the market price will not chang as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 . now, suppos a market oper face with thi situat want to sharpen the accuraci of the market. on natur approach is simpli to multipli all payoff by a constant. thi correspond to us a larger circl in the project game, and would inde improv the accuraci. howev, it will also increas the market-maker"s exposur to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more monei to achiev thi. the project game model suggest a natur approach to improv the accuraci while retain the same bound on the market maker"s loss. the idea is that, instead of restrict all move to be on the unit circl, we forc each move to have a slightli larger radiu than the previou move. suppos we insist that, if the current radiu is r, the next trader ha to move to r + 1. then, the trader"s expect profit would be e = r(1 − co(θ − θ )). us the same approxim as abov, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r. now, even if the market maker seed the market with r = 1, it would increas with each trade, and the incent to sharpen the estim increas with everi trade. 5.2 analyz long-term strategi up to thi point, our analysi ha been restrict to trader strategi that ar myopic in the sens that trader do not consid the impact of their trade on other trader"  belief. in practic, an inform trader can potenti profit by plai a suboptim strategi to mislead other trader, in a wai that allow her to profit later. in thi section, we illustr how the project game can be us to analyz an instanc of thi phenomenon, and to design market rule that mitig thi effect. the scenario we consid is as follow. there ar two trader specul on the probabl of an event e, who each get a 1-bit signal. the optim probabl for each  2bit signal pair is as follow. if trader 1 get the signal 0, and trader 2 get signal 0, the optim probabl is 0.3. if trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optim probabl is 0.9. if trader 1 get 1, and trader 2 get signal 0, the optim probabl is 0.7. if trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optim probabl is 0.1. (note that the impact of trader 2"s signal is in a differ direct, depend on trader 1"s signal). suppos that the prior distribut of the signal is that trader 1 is equal like to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 get a 0 with probabl 0.55 and a 1 with probabl 0.45. the trader ar plai the project game restrict to a circular arc. thi setup is depict in figur 4. a b d c x y signal opt. pt 00 c d11 10 01 event doe not happeneventhappen b a figur 4: exampl illustr non-myopic  decept suppos that, for some exogen reason, trader 1 ha the opportun to trade, follow by trader 2. then, trader 1 ha the option of place a last-minut trade just befor the market close. if trader were plai their myopic optim strategi, here is how the market should run: if trader 1 see a 0, he would move to some point y that is between a and c, but closer to c. trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 receiv a 0 signal and move to a or c if she got 1 or 0 respect. trader 1 ha no reason to move again. if trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a differ point x instead, and trader 2 would move to d if she saw 1 and b if she saw 0. again, trader 1 would not want to move again. us the project game, it is easi to show that, if trader consid non-myopic strategi, thi set of  strategi is not an equilibrium. the exact posit of the point doe not matter; all we need is the rel posit, and the observ that, becaus of the perfect symmetri in the setup, segment xy, bc, and ad ar all parallel to each other. now, suppos trader 1 got a 0. he could move to x instead of y , to mislead trader 2 into think he got a 1. then, when trader 2 move to, sai, d, trader 1 could correct the rate to a. to show that thi is a profit deviat, observ that thi strategi is equival to  plai two addit move over trader 1"s myopic strategi of move to y . the first move, y x mai either move toward or awai from the optim final posit. the second move, da or bc, is alwai in the correct direct. further,  becaus da and bc ar longer than xy , and parallel to xy , their project on the final p-line will alwai be greater 324 in absolut valu than the project of xy , regardless of what the true p-line is! thu, the decept would result in a strictli higher expect profit for trader 1. note that thi problem is not specif to the project game form: our equival result show that it could aris in the msr or dpm (perhap with a differ prior distribut and  differ numer valu). observ also that a strategi profil in which neither trader move in the first two round, and trader 1 move to either x or y would be a subgam-perfect equilibrium in thi setup. we suggest that on approach to mitig thi problem might be by reduc the radiu at everi move. thi  essenti provid a form of discount that motiv trader 1 to take hi profit earli rather than mislead trader 2.  graphic, the right reduct factor would make the segment ad and bc shorter than xy (as thei ar chord on a smaller circl), thu make the myopic strategi optim. 6. conclus and futur work we have present a simpl geometr game, the  project game, that can serv as a model for strateg behavior in inform market, as well as a tool to guid the  design of new inform market. we have us thi model to analyz the cost, profit, and strategi of a trader in a dynam parimutuel market, and shown that both the  dynam parimutuel market and the spheric market score rule ar strateg equival to the restrict project game under slight distort of the prior probabl. the gener analysi wa base on the assumpt that trader do not activ try to mislead other trader for futur profit. in section 5, howev, we analyz a small exampl market without thi assumpt. we demonstr that the project game can be us to analyz trader" strategi in thi scenario, and potenti to help design market with better strateg properti. our result rais sever veri interest open question. firstli, the payoff of the project game cannot be directli implement in situat in which the true probabl is not ultim reveal. it would be veri us to have an automat transform of a given project game into anoth game in which the payoff can be implement in expect without know the probabl, and preserv the strateg properti of the project game. second, given the tight connect between the project game and the spheric market score rule, it is natur to ask if we can find as strong a connect to other score rule or if not, to understand what strateg differ ar impli by the form of the score rule us in the market. final, the exist of long-rang manipul strategi in  inform market is of great interest. the exampl we studi in section 5 mere scratch the surfac of thi area. a gener studi of thi class of manipul, togeth with a character of market in which it can or cannot aris, would be veri us for the design of inform market. 7. refer [1] s. debnath, d. m. pennock, s. lawrenc, e. j. glover, and c. l. gile. inform incorpor in onlin in-game sport bet market. in proceed of the fourth annual acm confer on electron commerc (ec"03), page 258-259, june 2003.
