dengcai2@cs.uiuc.edu kun zhou microsoft research asia beij, china kunzhou@microsoft.com abstract relev feedback is a power techniqu to enhanc  contentbas imag retriev (cbir) perform. it solicit the user"s relev judgment on the retriev imag return by the cbir system. the user"s label is then us to learn a classifi to distinguish between relev and  irrelev imag. howev, the top return imag mai not be the most inform on. the challeng is thu to  determin which unlabel imag would be the most inform (i.e., improv the classifi the most) if thei were label and us as train sampl. in thi paper, we propos a novel activ learn algorithm, call laplacian  optim design (lod), for relev feedback imag retriev. our algorithm is base on a regress model which  minim the least squar error on the measur (or, label) imag and simultan preserv the local geometr structur of the imag space. specif, we assum that if two imag ar suffici close to each other, then their measur (or, label) ar close as well. by construct a nearest neighbor graph, the geometr structur of the imag space can be describ by the graph laplacian. we discuss how result from the field of optim experiment design mai be us to guid our select of a subset of  imag, which give us the most amount of inform.  experiment result on corel databas suggest that the propos approach achiev higher precis in relev feedback  imag retriev. categori and subject descriptor h.3.3 [inform storag and retriev]: inform search and retriev-relev feedback; g.3 [mathemat of comput]: probabl and statist-experiment design gener term algorithm, perform, theori 1. introduct in mani machin learn and inform retriev task, there is no shortag of unlabel data but label ar  expens. the challeng is thu to determin which unlabel sampl would be the most inform (i.e., improv the classifi the most) if thei were label and us as train sampl. thi problem is typic call activ learn [4]. here the task is to minim an overal cost, which depend both on the classifi accuraci and the cost of data  collect. mani real world applic can be cast into activ learn framework. particularli, we consid the problem of relev feedback driven content-base imag retriev (cbir) [13]. content-base imag retriev ha attract substanti interest in the last decad [13]. it is motiv by the fast growth of digit imag databas which, in turn, requir effici search scheme. rather than describ an imag  us text, in these system an imag queri is describ us on or more exampl imag. the low level visual featur (color, textur, shape, etc.) ar automat extract to repres the imag. howev, the low level featur mai not accur character the high level semant concept. to narrow down the semant gap, relev feedback is  introduc into cbir [12]. in mani of the current relev feedback driven cbir system, the user is requir to provid hi/her relev judgment on the top imag return by the system. the label imag ar then us to train a classifi to separ imag that match the queri concept from those that do not. howev, in gener the top return imag mai not be the most inform on. in the worst case, all the top imag label by the user mai be posit and thu the standard classif techniqu can not be appli due to the lack of neg exampl. unlik the standard classif problem where the label sampl ar  pregiven, in relev feedback imag retriev the system can activ select the imag to label. thu activ learn can be natur introduc into imag retriev. despit mani exist activ learn techniqu, support vector machin (svm) activ learn [14] and regress base activ learn [1] have receiv the most interest. base on the observ that the closer to the svm  boundari an imag is, the less reliabl it classif is, svm activ learn select those unlabel imag closest to the boundari to solicit user feedback so as to achiev maxim refin on the hyperplan between the two class. the major disadvantag of svm activ learn is that the  estim boundari mai not be accur enough. moreov, it mai not be appli at the begin of the retriev when there is no label imag. some other svm base activ learn algorithm can be found in [7], [9]. in statist, the problem of select sampl to label is typic refer to as experiment design. the sampl x is refer to as experi, and it label y is refer to as measur. the studi of optim experiment  design (o) [1] is concern with the design of experi that ar expect to minim varianc of a parameter model. the intent of optim experiment design is  usual to maxim confid in a given model, minim  paramet varianc for system identif, or minim the model"s output varianc. classic experiment design  approach includ a-optim design, d-optim design, and e-optim design. all of these approach ar base on a least squar regress model. compar to svm base activ learn algorithm, experiment design approach ar much more effici in comput. howev, thi kind of approach take onli measur (or, label) data into account in their object function, while the unmeasur (or, unlabel) data is ignor. benefit from recent progress on optim experiment design and semi-supervis learn, in thi paper we  propos a novel activ learn algorithm for imag retriev, call laplacian optim design (lod). unlik  tradit experiment design method whose loss function ar onli defin on the measur point, the loss function of our propos lod algorithm is defin on both measur and unmeasur point. specif, we introduc a local preserv regular into the standard least-squar-error base loss function. the new loss function aim to find a classifi which is local as smooth as possibl. in other word, if two point ar suffici close to each other in the input space, then thei ar expect to share the same label. onc the loss function is defin, we can select the most inform data point which ar present to the user for label. it would be import to note that the most inform imag mai not be the top return imag. the rest of the paper is organ as follow. in section 2, we provid a brief descript of the relat work. our propos laplacian optim design algorithm is introduc in section 3. in section 4, we compar our algorithm with the state-or-the-art algorithm and present the experiment result on imag retriev. final, we provid some  conclud remark and suggest for futur work in section 5. 2. relat work sinc our propos algorithm is base on regress  framework. the most relat work is optim experiment design [1], includ a-optim design, d-optim design, and  eoptim design. in thi section, we give a brief descript of these approach. 2.1 the activ learn problem the gener problem of activ learn is the follow. given a set of point a = {x1, x2, · · · , xm} in rd , find a subset b = {z1, z2, · · · , zk} ⊂ a which contain the most  inform point. in other word, the point zi(i = 1, · · · , k) can improv the classifi the most if thei ar label and us as train point. 2.2 optim experiment design we consid a linear regress model y = wt x + (1) where y is the observ, x is the independ variabl, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean. differ observ have error that ar  independ, but with equal varianc σ2 . we defin f(x) = wt x to be the learner"s output given input x and the weight vector w. suppos we have a set of label sampl point (z1, y1), · · · , (zk, yk), where yi is the label of zi. thu, the maximum likelihood estim for the weight vector, ˆw, is that which minim the sum squar error jsse(w) = k i=1 wt zi − yi 2 (2) the estim ˆw give us an estim of the output at a novel input: ˆy = ˆwt x. by gauss-markov theorem, we know that ˆw − w ha a zero mean and a covari matrix given by σ2 h−1 sse, where hsse is the hessian of jsse(w) hsse = ∂2 jsse ∂w2 = k i=1 zizt i = zzt where z = (z1, z2, · · · , zk). the three most common scalar measur of the size of the paramet covari matrix in optim experiment design ar: • d-optim design: determin of hsse. • a-optim design: trace of hsse. • e-optim design: maximum eigenvalu of hsse. sinc the comput of the determin and eigenvalu of a matrix is much more expens than the comput of matrix trace, a-optim design is more effici than the other two. some recent work on experiment design can be found in [6], [16]. 3. laplacian optim design sinc the covari matrix hsse us in tradit  approach is onli depend on the measur sampl, i.e. zi"s, these approach fail to evalu the expect error on the unmeasur sampl. in thi section, we introduc a novel activ learn algorithm call laplacian optim design (lod) which make effici us of both measur (label) and unmeasur (unlabel) sampl. 3.1 the object function in mani machin learn problem, it is natur to  assum that if two point xi, xj ar suffici close to each other, then their measur (f(xi), f(xj)) ar close as well. let s be a similar matrix. thu, a new loss function which respect the geometr structur of the data space can be defin as follow: j0(w) = k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 sij (3) where yi is the measur (or, label) of zi. note that, the loss function (3) is essenti the same as the on us in laplacian regular regress (lrr, [2]). howev, lrr is a passiv learn algorithm where the train data is given. in thi paper, we ar focus on how to select the most inform data for train. the loss function with our choic of symmetr weight sij (sij = sji) incur a heavi penalti if neighbor point xi and xj ar map far apart. therefor, minim j0(w) is an attempt to ensur that if xi and xj ar close then f(xi) and f(xj) ar close as well. there ar mani choic of the similar matrix s. a simpl definit is as follow: sij = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, if xi is among the p nearest neighbor of xj, or xj is among the p nearest neighbor of xi; 0, otherwis. (4) let d be a diagon matrix, dii = j sij, and l = d−s. the matrix l is call graph laplacian in spectral graph theori [3]. let y = (y1, · · · , yk)t and x = (x1, · · · , xm). follow some simpl algebra step, we see that: j0(w) = k i=1 wt zi − yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 wt xi − wt xj 2 sij = y − zt w t y − zt w + λwt m i=1 diixixt i − m i,j=1 sijxixt j w = yt y − 2wt zy + wt zzt w +λwt xdxt − xsxt w = yt y − 2wt zy + wt zzt + λxlxt w the hessian of j0(w) can be comput as follow: h0 = ∂2 j0 ∂w2 = zzt + λxlxt in some case, the matrix zzt +λxlxt is singular (e.g. if m < d). thu, there is no stabl solut to the optim problem eq. (3). a common wai to deal with thi ill-pose problem is to introduc a tikhonov regular into our loss function: j(w) = k i=1 wt zi − yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 wt xi − wt xj 2 sij +λ2 w 2 (5) the hessian of the new loss function is given by: h = ∂2 j ∂w2 = zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i := zzt + Λ where i is an ident matrix and Λ = λ1xlxt + λ2i. clearli, h is of full rank. requir that the gradient of j(w) with respect to w vanish give the optim estim ˆw: ˆw = h−1 zy the follow proposit state the bia and varianc  properti of the estim for the coeffici vector w. proposit 3.1. e( ˆw − w) = −h−1 Λw, cov( ˆw) = σ2 (h−1 − h−1 Λh−1 ) proof. sinc y = zt w + and e( ) = 0, it follow that e( ˆw − w) (6) = h−1 zzt w − w = h−1 (zzt + Λ − Λ)w − w = (i − h−1 Λ)w − w = −h−1 Λw (7) notic cov(y) = σ2 i, the covari matrix of ˆw ha the express: cov( ˆw) = h−1 zcov(y)zt h−1 = σ2 h−1 zzt h−1 = σ2 h−1 (h − Λ)h−1 = σ2 (h−1 − h−1 Λh−1 ) (8) therefor mean squar error matrix for the coeffici w is e(w − ˆw)(w − ˆw)t (9) = h−1 Λwwt Λh−1 + σ2 (h−1 − h−1 Λh−1 ) (10) for ani x, let ˆy = ˆwt x be it predict observ. the expect squar predict error is e(y − ˆy)2 = e( + wt x − ˆwt x)2 = σ2 + xt [e(w − ˆw)(w − ˆw)t ]x = σ2 + xt [h−1 Λwwt Λh−1 + σ2 h−1 − σ2 h−1 Λh−1 ]x clearli the expect squar predict error depend on the explanatori variabl x, therefor averag expect squar predict error over the complet data set a is 1 m m i=1 e(yi − ˆwt xi)2 = 1 m m i=1 xt i [h−1 Λwwt Λh−1 + σ2 h−1 − σ2 h−1 Λh−1 ]xi +σ2 = 1 m tr(xt [σ2 h−1 + h−1 Λwwt Λh−1 − σ2 h−1 Λh−1 ]x) +σ2 sinc tr(xt [h−1 Λwwt Λh−1 − σ2 h−1 Λh−1 ]x) tr(σ2 xt h−1 x), our laplacian optim criterion is thu formul by minim the trace of xt h−1 x. definit 1. laplacian optim design min z=(z1,··· ,zk) tr xt zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 x (11) where z1, · · · , zk ar select from {x1, · · · , xm}. 4. kernel laplacian optim design canon experiment design approach (e.g. a-optim design, d-optim design, and e-optim) onli consid linear function. thei fail to discov the intrins geometri in the data when the data space is highli nonlinear. in thi section, we describ how to perform laplacian  experiment design in reproduc kernel hilbert space (rkh) which give rise to kernel laplacian experiment design (klod). for given data point x1, · · · , xm ∈ x with a posit definit mercer kernel k : x ×x → r, there exist a uniqu rkh hk of real valu function on x. let kt(s) be the function of s obtain by fix t and let kt(s) . = k(s, t). hk consist of all finit linear combin of the form l i=1 αikti with ti ∈ x and limit of such function as the ti becom dens in x. we have ks, kt hk = k(s, t). 4.1 deriv of lod in reproduc kernel hilbert space consid the optim problem (5) in rkh. thu, we seek a function f ∈ hk such that the follow object function is minim: min f∈hk k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 sij+λ2 f 2 hk (12) we have the follow proposit. proposit 4.1. let h = { m i=1 αik(·, xi)|αi ∈ r} be a subspac of hk , the solut to the problem (12) is in h. proof. let h⊥ be the orthogon complement of h, i.e. hk = h ⊕ h⊥ . thu, for ani function f ∈ hk , it ha orthogon decomposit as follow: f = fh + fh⊥ now, let"s evalu f at xi: f(xi) = f, kxi hk = fh + fh⊥ , kxi hk = fh, kxi hk + fh⊥ , kxi hk notic that kxi ∈ h while fh⊥ ∈ h⊥ . thi impli that fh⊥ , kxi hk = 0. therefor, f(xi) = fh, kxi hk = fh(xi) thi complet the proof. proposit 4.1 tell us the minim of problem (12) admit a represent f∗ = m i=1 αik(·, xi). pleas see [2] for the detail. let φ : rd → h be a featur map from the input space rd to h, and k(xi, xj) =< φ(xi), φ(xj) >. let x denot the data matrix in rkh, x = (φ(x1), φ(x2), · · · , φ(xm)). similarli, we defin z = (φ(z1), φ(z2), · · · , φ(zk)). thu, the optim problem in rkh can be written as follow: min z tr xt zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 x (13) sinc the map function φ is gener unknown, there is no direct wai to solv problem (13). in the follow, we appli kernel trick to solv thi optim problem. let x−1 be the moor-penros invers (also known as pseudo invers) of x. thu, we have: xt zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 x = xt xx−1 zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 (xt )−1 xt x = xt x zzt x + λ1xlxt x + λ2x −1 (xt )−1 xt x = xt x xt zzt x + λ1xt xlxt x + λ2xt x −1 xt x = kxx kxzkzx + λ1kxxlkxx + λ2kxx −1 kxx where kxx is a m × m matrix (kxx,ij = k(xi, xj)), kxz is a m×k matrix (kxz,ij = k(xi, zj)), and kzx is a k×m matrix (kzx,ij = k(zi, xj)). thu, the kernel laplacian optim design can be defin as follow: definit 2. kernel laplacian optim design minz=(z1,··· ,zk) tr kxx kxzkzx + λ1kxxlkxx λ2kxx −1 kxx (14) 4.2 optim scheme in thi subsect, we discuss how to solv the  optim problem (11) and (14). particularli, if we select a linear kernel for klod, then it reduc to lod. therefor, we will focu on problem (14) in the follow. it can be shown that the optim problem (14) is np-hard. in thi subsect, we develop a simpl sequenti greedi approach to solv (14). suppos n point have been select, denot by a matrix zn = (z1, · · · , zn). the (n + 1)-th point zn+1 can be select by solv the follow optim problem: max zn+1=(zn,zn+1) tr kxx kxzn+1 kzn+1x + λ1kxxlkxx + λ2kxx −1 kxx (15) the kernel matric kxzn+1 and kzn+1x can be rewritten as follow: kxzn+1 = kxzn , kxzn+1 , kzn+1x = kznx kzn+1x thu, we have: kxzn+1 kzn+1x = kxzn kznx + kxzn+1 kzn+1x we defin: a = kxzn kznx + λ1kxxlkxx + λ2kxx a is onli depend on x and zn . thu, the (n + 1)-th point zn+1 is given by: zn+1 = arg min zn+1 tr kxx a + kxzn+1 kzn+1x −1 kxx (16) each time we select a new point zn+1, the matrix a is  updat by: a ← a + kxzn+1 kzn+1x if the kernel function is chosen as inner product k(x, y) = x, y , then hk is a linear function space and the  algorithm reduc to lod. 5. content-base imag retriev us laplacian optim design in thi section, we describ how to appli laplacian  optim design to cbir. we begin with a brief descript of imag represent us low level visual featur. 5.1 low-level imag represent low-level imag represent is a crucial problem in cbir. gener visual featur includ color, textur, shape, etc. color and textur featur ar the most extens us visual featur in cbir. compar with color and textur featur, shape featur ar usual describ after imag have been segment into region or object. sinc robust and accur imag segment is difficult to achiev, the us of shape featur for imag retriev ha been limit to special applic where object or region ar readili avail. in thi work, we combin 64-dimension color histogram and 64-dimension color textur moment (ctm, [15]) to repres the imag. the color histogram is calcul  us 4 × 4 × 4 bin in hsv space. the color textur  moment is propos by yu et al. [15], which integr the color and textur characterist of the imag in a compact form. ctm adopt local fourier transform as a textur  represent scheme and deriv eight characterist map to describ differ aspect of co-occurr relat of  imag pixel in each channel of the (svcosh, svsinh, v) color space. then ctm calcul the first and second moment of these map as a represent of the natur color imag pixel distribut. pleas see [15] for detail. 5.2 relev feedback imag retriev relev feedback is on of the most import  techniqu to narrow down the gap between low level visual featur and high level semant concept [12].  tradition, the user"s relev feedback ar us to updat the queri vector or adjust the weight of differ dimens. thi process can be view as an on-line learn process in which the imag retriev system act as a learner and the user act as a teacher. thei typic retriev process is  outlin as follow: 1. the user submit a queri imag exampl to the  system. the system rank the imag in databas  accord to some pre-defin distanc metric and present to the user the top rank imag. 2. the system select some imag from the databas and request the user to label them as relev or  irrelev. 3. the system us the user"s provid inform to  rerank the imag in databas and return to the user the top imag. go to step 2 until the user is satisfi. our laplacian optim design algorithm is appli in the second step for select the most inform imag. onc we get the label for the imag select by lod, we appli laplacian regular regress (lrr, [2]) to solv the optim problem (3) and build the classifi. the  classifi is then us to re-rank the imag in databas. note that, in order to reduc the comput complex, we do not us all the unlabel imag in the databas but onli those within top 500 return of previou iter. 6. experiment result in thi section, we evalu the perform of our  propos algorithm on a larg imag databas. to demonstr the effect of our propos lod algorithm, we  compar it with laplacian regular regress (lrr, [2]), support vector machin (svm), support vector machin activ learn (svmactiv) [14], and a-optim design (aod). both svmactiv, aod, and lod ar activ  learn algorithm, while lrr and svm ar standard  classif algorithm. svm onli make us of the label imag, while lrr is a semi-supervis learn algorithm which make us of both label and unlabel imag. for svmactiv, aod, and lod, 10 train imag ar select by the algorithm themselv at each iter. while for lrr and svm, we us the top 10 imag as train data. it would be import to note that svmactiv is base on the ordinari svm, lod is base on lrr, and aod is base on the ordinari regress. the paramet λ1 and λ2 in our lod algorithm ar empir set to be 0.001 and 0.00001. for both lrr and lod algorithm, we us the same graph structur (see eq. 4) and set the valu of p (number of  nearest neighbor) to be 5. we begin with a simpl synthet exampl to give some intuit about how lod work. 6.1 simpl synthet exampl a simpl synthet exampl is given in figur 1. the data set contain two circl. eight point ar select by aod and lod. as can be seen, all the point select by aod ar from the big circl, while lod select four point from the big circl and four from the small circl. the number besid the select point denot their order to be select. clearli, the point select by our lod algorithm can better repres the origin data set. we did not compar our algorithm with svmactiv becaus svmactiv can not be appli in thi case due to the lack of the label point. 6.2 imag retriev experiment design the imag databas we us consist of 7,900 imag of 79 semant categori, from corel data set. it is a larg and heterogen imag set. each imag is repres as a 128-dimension vector as describ in section 5.1. figur 2 show some sampl imag. to exhibit the advantag of us our algorithm, we need a reliabl wai of evalu the retriev perform and the comparison with other algorithm. we list differ aspect of the experiment design below. 6.2.1 evalu metric we us precis-scope curv and precis rate [10] to evalu the effect of the imag retriev algorithm. the scope is specifi by the number (n) of top-rank  imag present to the user. the precis is the ratio of the number of relev imag present to the user to the (a) data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) aod 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) lod figur 1: data select by activ learn algorithm. the number besid the select point denot their order to be select. clearli, the point select by our lod algorithm can better repres the origin data set. note that, the svmactiv algorithm can not be appli in thi case due to the lack of label point. (a) (b) (c) figur 2: sampl imag from categori bead, eleph, and ship. scope n. the precis-scope curv describ the precis with variou scope and thu give an overal perform evalu of the algorithm. on the other hand, the  precis rate emphas the precis at a particular valu of scope. in gener, it is appropri to present 20 imag on a screen. put more imag on a screen mai affect the qualiti of the present imag. therefor, the precis at top 20 (n = 20) is especi import. in real world imag retriev system, the queri imag is usual not in the imag databas. to simul such  environ, we us five-fold cross valid to evalu the  algorithm. more precis, we divid the whole imag databas into five subset with equal size. thu, there ar 20 imag per categori in each subset. at each run of cross valid, on subset is select as the queri set, and the other four subset ar us as the databas for retriev. the  precisionscop curv and precis rate ar comput by averag the result from the five-fold cross valid. 6.2.2 automat relev feedback scheme we design an automat feedback scheme to model the retriev process. for each submit queri, our system  retriev and rank the imag in the databas. 10 imag were select from the databas for user label and the label inform is us by the system for re-rank. note that, the imag which have been select at previou  iter ar exclud from later select. for each queri, the automat relev feedback mechan is perform for four iter. it is import to note that the automat relev  feedback scheme us here is differ from the on describ in [8], [11]. in [8], [11], the top four relev and irrelev imag were select as the feedback imag. howev, thi mai not be practic. in real world imag retriev system, it is possibl that most of the top-rank imag ar relev (or, irrelev). thu, it is difficult for the user to find both four relev and irrelev imag. it is more reason for the user to provid feedback inform onli on the 10 imag select by the system. 6.3 imag retriev perform in real world, it is not practic to requir the user to provid mani round of feedback. the retriev  perform after the first two round of feedback (especi the first round) is more import. figur 3 show the averag precis-scope curv of the differ algorithm for the first two feedback iter. at the begin of retriev, the euclidean distanc in the origin 128-dimension space ar us to rank the imag in databas. after the user provid relev feedback, the lrr, svm, svmactiv, aod, and lod algorithm ar then appli to re-rank the imag. in order to reduc the time complex of activ learn algorithm, we didn"t select the most inform imag from the whole databas but from the top 500  imag. for lrr and svm, the user is requir to label the top 10 imag. for svmactiv, aod, and lod, the user is requir to label 10 most inform imag select by these algorithm. note that, svmactiv can onli be  ap(a) feedback iter 1 (b) feedback iter 2 figur 3: the averag precis-scope curv of differ algorithm for the first two feedback iter. the lod algorithm perform the best on the entir scope. note that, at the first round of feedback, the svmactiv algorithm can not be appli. it appli the ordinari svm to build the initi classifi.

(a) precis at top 10, (b) precis at top 20, and (c) precis at top 30. as can be seen, our lod algorithm consist outperform the other four algorithm. pli when the classifi is alreadi built. therefor, it can not be appli at the first round and we us the standard svm to build the initi classifi. as can be seen, our lod algorithm outperform the other four algorithm on the  entir scope. also, the lrr algorithm perform better than svm. thi is becaus that the lrr algorithm make  effici us of the unlabel imag by incorpor a local preserv regular into the ordinari regress object function. the aod algorithm perform the worst. as the scope get larger, the perform differ between these algorithm get smaller. by iter ad the user"s feedback, the  correspond precis result (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithm ar respect shown in figur 4. as can be seen, our lod algorithm perform the best in all the case and the lrr algorithm perform the second best. both of these two algorithm make us of the unlabel imag. thi show that the unlabel imag ar help for discov the intrins geometr structur of the imag space and therefor enhanc the retriev perform. in real world, the user mai not be will to provid too mani relev feedback. therefor, the retriev perform at the first two round ar especi import. as can be seen, our lod algorithm achiev 6.8% perform improv for top 10 result, 5.2% for top 20 result, and 4.1% for top 30 result, compar to the second best algorithm (lrr) after the first two round of relev feedback. 6.4 discuss sever experi on corel databas have been  systemat perform. we would like to highlight sever  interest point: 1. it is clear that the us of activ learn is benefici in the imag retriev domain. there is a signific increas in perform from us the activ learn method. especi, out of the three activ learn method (svmactiv, aod, lod), our propos lod algorithm perform the best. 2. in mani real world applic like relev  feedback imag retriev, there ar gener two wai of reduc labor-intens manual label task. on is activ learn which select the most inform  sampl to label, and the other is semi-supervis learn which make us of the unlabel sampl to enhanc the learn perform. both of these two  strategi have been studi extens in the past [14], [7], [5], [8]. the work present in thi paper is  focus on activ learn, but it also take advantag of the recent progress on semi-supervis learn [2]. specif, we incorpor a local preserv  regular into the standard regress framework and find the most inform sampl with respect to the new object function. in thi wai, the activ learn and semi-supervis learn techniqu ar seamlessli unifi for learn an optim classifi. 3. the relev feedback techniqu is crucial to imag retriev. for all the five algorithm, the retriev  perform improv with more feedback provid by the user. 7. conclus and futur work thi paper describ a novel activ learn algorithm, call laplacian optim design, to enabl more effect relev feedback imag retriev. our algorithm is base on an object function which simultan minim the empir error and preserv the local geometr structur of the data space. us techniqu from experiment  design, our algorithm find the most inform imag to label. these label imag and the unlabel imag in the databas ar us to learn a classifi. the  experiment result on corel databas show that both activ learn and semi-supervis learn can significantli improv the retriev perform. in thi paper, we consid the imag retriev problem on a small, static, and close-domain imag data. a much more challeng domain is the world wide web (www). for web imag search, it is possibl to collect a larg amount of user click inform. thi inform can be natur us to construct the affin graph in our algorithm.  howev, the comput complex in web scenario mai  becom a crucial issu. also, although our primari interest in thi paper is focus on relev feedback imag retriev, our result mai also be of interest to research in patten recognit and machin learn, especi when a larg amount of data is avail but onli a limit sampl can be label. 8. refer [1] a. c. atkinson and a. n. donev. optimum experiment design. oxford univers press, 2002.
