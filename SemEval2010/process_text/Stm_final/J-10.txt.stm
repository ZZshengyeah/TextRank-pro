[12] propos the brag-and-moan model where user rate onli if their util of the product (drawn from a normal distribut) fall outsid a median interv. the author conclud that the model explain the empir distribut of report, and offer insight into smarter wai of estim the true qualiti of the product. in the present paper we extend thi line of research, and attempt to explain further fact about the behavior of user when report onlin feedback. us actual hotel review from the tripadvisor2 websit, we consid two addit sourc of inform besid the basic numer rate submit by user. the first is simpl linguist evid from the textual review that usual accompani the  numer rate. we us text-mine techniqu similar to [7] and [3], howev, we ar onli interest in identifi what aspect of the servic the user is discuss, without comput the semant orient of the text. we find that user who comment more on the same featur ar more like to agre on a common numer rate for that  particular featur. intuit, lengthi comment reveal the  import of the featur to the user. sinc peopl tend to be more knowledg in the aspect thei consid import, user who discuss a given featur in more detail might be assum to have more author in evalu that featur. second we investig the relationship between a review 1 http://www.amazon.com 2 http://www.tripadvisor.com/ 134 figur 1: the tripadvisor page displai review for a popular boston hotel. name of hotel and  advertis were delib eras. and the review that preced it. a perus of onlin  review show that rate ar often part of discuss thread, where on post is not necessarili independ of other post. on mai see, for exampl, user who make an effort to  contradict, or vehement agre with, the remark of previou user. by analyz the time sequenc of report, we  conclud that past review influenc the futur report, as thei creat some prior expect regard the qualiti of  servic. the subject percept of the user is influenc by the gap between the prior expect and the actual  perform of the servic [17, 18, 16, 21] which will later reflect in the user"s rate. we propos a model that captur the depend of rate on prior expect, and valid it us the empir data we collect. both result can be us to improv the wai reput mechan aggreg the inform from individu  review. our first result can be us to determin a  featurebi-featur estim of qualiti, where for each featur, a  differ subset of review (i.e., those with lengthi comment of that featur) is consid. the second lead to an  algorithm that output a more precis estim of the real qualiti. 2. the data set we us in thi paper real hotel review collect from the popular travel site tripadvisor. tripadvisor index hotel from citi across the world, along with review written by travel. user can search the site by give the hotel"s name and locat (option). the review for a given hotel ar displai as a list (order from the most recent to the oldest), with 5 review per page. the review contain: • inform about the author of the review (e.g., date of stai, usernam of the review, locat of the  review); • the overal rate (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest); • a textual review contain a titl for the review, free comment, and the main thing the review like and dislik; • numer rate (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) for differ featur (e.g., cleanli, servic, locat, etc.) below the name of the hotel, tripadvisor displai the address of the hotel, gener inform (number of room, number of star, short descript, etc), the averag overal rate, the tripadvisor rank, and an averag rate for each featur. figur 1 show the page for a popular boston hotel whose name (along with advertis) wa explicitli eras. we select three citi for thi studi: boston, sydnei and la vega. for each citi we consid all hotel that had at least 10 review, and record all review. tabl 1 present the number of hotel consid in each citi, the total number of review record for each citi, and the  distribut of hotel with respect to the star-rate (as  avail on the tripadvisor site). note that not all hotel have a star-rate. tabl 1: a summari of the data set. citi # review # hotel # of hotel with 1,2,3,4 & 5 star boston 3993 58 1+3+17+15+2 sydnei 1371 47 0+0+9+13+10 la vega 5593 40 0+3+10+9+6 for each review we record the overal rate, the  textual review (titl and bodi of the review) and the numer rate on 7 featur: room(r), servic(s), cleanli(c), valu(v), food(f), locat(l) and nois(n).  tripadvisor doe not requir user to submit anyth other than the overal rate, henc a typic review rate few  addit featur, regardless of the discuss in the textual comment. onli the featur room(r), servic(s),  cleanli(c) and valu(v) ar rate by a signific number of user. howev, we also select the featur food(f), locat(l) and nois(n) becaus thei ar refer to in a signific number of textual comment. for each featur we record the numer rate given by the user, or 0 when the rate is miss. the typic length of the textual comment amount to approxim 200 word. all data wa collect by crawl the tripadvisor site in septemb 2006. 2.1 formal notat we will formal refer to a review by a tupl (r, t) where: • r = (rf ) is a vector contain the rate rf ∈ {0, 1, . . . 5} for the featur f ∈ f = {o, r, s, c, v, f, l, n}; note that the overal rate, ro, is abus record as the rate for the featur overal(o); • t is the textual comment that accompani the review. 135 review ar index accord to the variabl i, such that (ri , ti ) is the ith review in our databas. sinc we don"t record the usernam of the review, we will also sai that the ith review in our data set wa submit by user i. when we need to consid onli the review of a given hotel, h, we will us (ri(h) , ti(h) ) to denot the ith review about the hotel h. 3. evid from textual comment the free textual comment associ to onlin review ar a valuabl sourc of inform for understand the reason behind the numer rate left by the review. the text mai, for exampl, reveal concret exampl of  aspect that the user like or dislik, thu justifi some of the high, respect low rate for certain featur. the text mai also offer guidelin for understand the  prefer of the review, and the weight of differ featur when comput an overal rate. the problem, howev, is that free textual comment ar difficult to read. user ar requir to scroll through mani review and read mostli repetit inform. signific improv would be obtain if the review were  automat interpret and aggreg. unfortun, thi seem a difficult task for comput sinc human user often us witti languag, abbrevi, cultur specif phrase, and the figur style. nevertheless, sever import result us the textual comment of onlin review in an autom wai. us well establish natur languag techniqu, review or part of review can be classifi as have a posit or neg  semant orient. pang et al.

[3] who look at larg collect of review crawl from the web. thei show that the size of the data set is import, and that bigger train set allow classifi to successfulli us more complex classif featur base on n-gram. hu and liu [11] also crawl the web for product review and automat identifi product attribut that have been  discuss by review. thei us wordnet to comput the  semant orient of product evalu and summar user review by extract posit and neg evalu of differ product featur. popescu and etzioni [20]  analyz a similar set, but us search engin hit-count to identifi product attribut; the semant orient is  assign through the relax label techniqu. ghose et al. [7, 8] analyz seller review from the amazon secondari market to identifi the differ dimens (e.g., deliveri, packag, custom support, etc.) of reput. thei pars the text, and tag the part-of-speech for

reput measur correl better with the price  inform observ in the market. pavlou and dimoka [19] analyz ebai review and find that textual comment have an import impact on reput premium. our approach is similar to the previous mention work, in the sens that we identifi the aspect (i.e.,  hotel featur) discuss by the user in the textual review. howev, we do not comput the semant orient of the text, nor attempt to infer miss rate. we defin the weight, wi f , of featur f ∈ f in the text ti associ with the review (ri , ti ), as the fraction of ti dedic to discuss aspect (both posit and neg) relat to featur f. we propos an elementari method to approxim the valu of these weight. for each featur we manual construct the word list lf contain  approxim 50 word that ar most commonli associ to the featur f. the initi word were select from read some of the review, and see what word coincid with  discuss of which featur. the list wa then extend by ad all thesauru entri that were relat to the initi word. final, we brainstorm for miss word that would  normal be associ with each of the featur. let lf ∩ti be the list of term common to both lf and ti. each term of lf is count the number of time it appear in ti , with two except: • in case where the user submit a titl to the review, we account for the titl text by append it three time to the review text ti . the intuit assumpt is that the user"s opinion is more strongli reflect in the titl, rather than in the bodi of the review. for exampl, mani review ar accur summar by titl such as excel servic, terribl locat or bad valu for monei; • certain word that occur onli onc in the text ar count multipl time if their relev to that  featur is particularli strong. these were "root" word for each featur (e.g., "staff" is a root word for the featur servic), and were weight either 2 or 3. each  featur wa assign up to 3 such root word, so almost all word ar count onli onc. the list of word for the featur room is given for refer in appendix a. the weight wi f is comput as: wi f = |lf ∩ ti| f∈f |lf ∩ ti| (1) where |lf ∩ti | is the number of term common to lf and ti . the weight for the featur overal wa set to min{ |t i | 5000 , 1} where |ti | is the number of charact in ti . the follow is a tripadvisor review for a boston hotel (the name of the hotel is omit): i"ll start by sai that i"m more of a holidai inn person than a *** type. so i get frustrat when i pai doubl the room rate and get half the amen that i"d get at a hampton inn or holidai inn. the locat wa definit the main asset of thi place. it wa onli a few block from the hyne center subwai stop and it wa easi to walk to some good restaur in the back bai area. boylston isn"t far off at all. so i had no troubl with forego a rental car and take the subwai from the  airport to the hotel and us the subwai for ani other travel. otherwis, thei make you pai for anyth and everyth. 136 and when you"ve alreadi drop $215/night on the room, that get frustrat.the room itself wa decent, about what i would expect. staff wa also averag, not bad and not  excel. again, i think you"re pai for locat and the abil to walk to a lot of good stuff. but i think next time i"ll stai in brooklin, get more amen, and us the subwai a bit more. thi numer rate associ to thi review ar ro = 3, rr = 3, rs = 3, rc = 4, rv = 2 for featur overal(o), room(r), servic(s), cleanli(c) and valu(v)  respect. the rate for the featur food(f), locat(l) and nois(n) ar absent (i.e., rf = rl = rn = 0). the weight wf ar comput from the follow list of common term: lr ∩ t ={room}; wr = 0.066 ls ∩ t ={3 * staff, amen}; ws = 0.267 lc ∩ t = ∅; wc = 0 lv ∩ t ={$, rate}; wv = 0.133 lf ∩ t ={restaur}; wf = 0.067 ll ∩ t ={2 * center, 2 * walk, 2 * locat, area}; wl = 0.467 ln ∩ t = ∅; wn = 0 the root word "staff" and "center" were tripl and  doubl respect. the overal weight of the textual review is wo = 0.197. these valu account reason well for the weight of differ featur in the discuss of the review. on point to note is that some term in the list lf possess an inher semant orient. for exampl the word "grime" (belong to the list lc ) would be us most often to assert the presenc, and not the absenc of grime. thi is unavoid, but care wa taken to ensur word from both side of the spectrum were us. for thi reason, some list such as lr contain onli noun of object that on would typic describ in a room (see appendix a). the goal of thi section is to analys the influenc of the weight wi f on the numer rate ri f . intuit, user who spent a lot of their time discuss a featur f (i.e., wi f is high) had someth to sai about their experi with regard to thi featur. obvious, featur f is import for user i. sinc peopl tend to be more knowledg in the aspect thei consid import, our hypothesi is that the rate ri f (correspond to high weight wi f ) constitut a subset of expert rate for featur f. figur 2 plot the distribut of the rate r i(h) c with  respect to the weight w i(h) c for the cleanli of a la vega hotel, h. here, the high rate ar restrict to the review that discuss littl the cleanli. whenev cleanli  appear in the discuss, the rate ar low. mani hotel exhibit similar rate pattern for variou featur. rate correspond to low weight span the whole spectrum from 1 to 5, while the rate correspond to high weight ar more group togeth (either around good or bad rate). we therefor make the follow hypothesi: hypothesi 1. the rate ri f correspond to the  review where wi f is high, ar more similar to each other than to the overal collect of rate. to test the hypothesi, we take the entir set of review, and featur by featur, we comput the standard deviat of the rate with high weight, and the standard deviat of the entir set of rate. high weight were defin as those belong to the upper 20% of the weight rang for the correspond featur. if hypothesi 1 were true, the standard deviat of all rate should be higher than the standard deviat of the rate with high weight. 0 1 2 3

comput better qualiti estim. we can, for exampl, construct a featur-by-featur qualiti estim with much lower varianc: for each featur we take the  subset of review that ampli discuss that featur, and output as a qualiti estim the averag rate for thi subset.  initi experi suggest that the averag featur-by-featur rate comput in thi wai ar differ from the averag rate comput on the whole data set. given that,  inde, high weight ar indic of expert opinion, the estim obtain in thi wai ar more accur than the current on. nevertheless, the valid of thi underli assumpt requir further control experi. 137 4. the influenc of past rate two import assumpt ar gener made about  review submit to onlin forum. the first is that rate truthfulli reflect the qualiti observ by the user; the  second is that review ar independ from on anoth. while anecdot evid [9, 22] challeng the first assumpt3 , in thi section, we address the second. a perus of onlin review show that review ar often part of discuss thread, where user make an effort to contradict, or vehement agre with the remark of previou user. consid, for exampl, the follow review: i don"t understand the neg review... the hotel wa a littl dark, but that wa the style. it wa veri artsi. ye it wa close to the freewai, but in my opinion the sound of an occasion loud car is better than hear the ding ding of slot machin all night! the staff on-hand is  fabul. the waitress ar great (and *** doe not deserv the bad review she got, she wa 100% attent to us!), the bartend ar friendli and profession at the same time... here, the user wa disturb by previou neg report, address these concern, and set about try to correct them. not surprisingli, hi rate were consider higher than the averag rate up to thi point. it seem that tripadvisor user regularli read the report submit by previou user befor book a hotel, or  befor write a review. past review creat some prior  expect regard the qualiti of servic, and thi expect ha an influenc on the submit review. we believ thi observ hold for most onlin forum. the subject percept of qualiti is directli proport to how well the actual experi meet the prior expect, a fact confirm by an import line of econometr and  market research [17, 18, 16, 21]. the correl between the review ha also been  confirm by recent research on the dynam of onlin review forum [6]. 4.1 prior expect we defin the prior expect of user i regard the featur f, as the averag of the previous avail rate on the featur f4 : ef (i) = j<i,r j f =0 rj f j<i,r j f =0 1 as a first hypothesi, we assert that the rate ri f is a function of the prior expect ef (i): hypothesi 2. for a given hotel and featur, given the review i and j such that ef (i) is high and ef (j) is low, the rate rj f exce the rate ri f . we defin high and low expect as those that ar abov, respect below a certain cutoff valu θ. the set of review preced by high, respect low expect 3 part of amazon review were recogn as strateg post by book author or

to the averag rate across all featur across all hotel, and is justifi by the fact that our data set contain mostli high qualiti hotel. for each citi, we take all hotel and comput the averag rate in the set rhigh f and rlow f (see tabl 3). the averag rate amongst review follow low prior expect is significantli higher than the averag rate follow high expect. as further evid, we consid all hotel for which the function ev (i) (the expect for the featur valu) ha a high valu (greater than 4) for some i, and a low valu (less than 4) for some other i. intuit, these ar the hotel for which there is a minim degre of variat in the time sequenc of review: i.e., the cumul averag of rate wa at some point high and afterward becam low, or vice-versa. such variat ar observ for about half of all hotel in

acquir by  read report submit by past user. in thi case, an overli high valu for ef (i) would drive the user to  submit a neg report (or vice versa), stem from the differ between the actual valu of the servic, and the inflat expect of thi valu acquir  befor hi experi. • the expect valu of featur f for all subsequ  visitor of the site, if user i were not to submit a report. in thi case, the motiv for a neg report  follow an overli high valu of ef is differ: user i seek to correct the expect of futur visitor to the site. unlik the interpret abov, thi doe not requir the user to deriv an a priori expect for the valu of f. note that neither interpret impli that the averag up to report i is invers relat to the rate at report i. there might exist a measur of influenc exert by past report that push the user behind report i to submit  rate which to some extent conform with past report: a low valu for ef (i) can influenc user i to submit a low rate for featur f becaus, for exampl, he fear that submit a high rate will make him out to be a person with low standard5 . thi, at first, appear to contradict hypothesi 2. howev, thi conform rate cannot continu  indefinit: onc the set of report project a suffici deflat estim for vf , futur review with compar posit impress will seek to correct thi misconcept. 4.2 impact of textual comment on qualiti expect further insight into the rate behavior of tripadvisor user can be obtain by analyz the relationship between the weight wf and the valu ef (i). in particular, we  examin the follow hypothesi: hypothesi 3. when a larg proport of the text of a review discuss a certain featur, the differ between the rate for that featur and the averag rate up to that point tend to be larg. the intuit behind thi claim is that when the user is adam about voic hi opinion regard a certain  featur, hi opinion differ from the collect opinion of  previou post. thi reli on the characterist of reput system as feedback forum where a user is interest in  project hi opinion, with particular strength if thi opinion differ from what he perceiv to be the gener opinion. to test hypothesi 3 we measur the averag absolut differ between the expect ef (i) and the rate ri f when the weight wi f is high, respect low. weight ar classifi high or low by compar them with certain cutoff valu: wi f is low if smaller than 0.1, while wi f is high if greater than θf . differ cutoff valu were us for  differ featur: θr = 0.4, θs = 0.4, θc = 0.2, and θv = 0.7. cleanli ha a lower cutoff sinc it is a featur rare discuss; valu ha a high cutoff for the opposit reason.

that user ar more like to submit a report when thei believ thei have someth distinct to add to the current stream of opinion for some featur. such conclus ar in total agreement with prior evid that the distribut of report often follow bi-modal, u-shape distribut. 139 5. model the behavior of rater to account for the observ describ in the previou section, we propos a model for the behavior of the user when submit onlin review. for a given hotel, we make the assumpt that the qualiti experienc by the user is normal distribut around some valu vf , which repres the object qualiti offer by the hotel on the featur f. the rate submit by user i on featur f is: ˆri f = δf vi f + (1 − δf ) · sign vi f − ef (i) c + d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) (2) where: • vi f is the (unknown) qualiti actual experienc by the user. vi f is assum normal distribut around some valu vf ; • δf ∈ [0, 1] can be seen as a measur of the bia when report feedback. high valu reflect the fact that user rate object, without be influenc by prior expect. the valu of δf mai depend on variou factor; we fix on valu for each featur f; • c is a constant between 1 and 5; • wi f is the weight of featur f in the textual comment of review i, comput accord to eq. (1); • d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) is a distanc function between the  expect and the observ of user i. the distanc function satisfi the follow properti: - d(y, z|w) ≥ 0 for all y, z ∈ [0, 5], w ∈ [0, 1]; - |d(y, z|w)| < |d(z, x|w)| if |y − z| < |z − x|; - |d(y, z|w1)| < |d(y, z|w2)| if w1 < w2; - c + d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) ∈ [1, 5]; the second term of eq. (2) encod the bia of the rate. the higher the distanc between the true  observ vi f and the function ef , the higher the bia. 5.1 model valid we us the data set of tripadvisor review to valid the behavior model present abov. we split for conveni the rate valu in three rang: bad (b = {1, 2}),  indiffer (i = {3, 4}), and good (g = {5}), and perform the follow two test: • first, we will us our model to predict the rate that have extrem valu. for everi hotel, we take the  sequenc of report, and whenev we encount a rate that is either good or bad (but not indiffer) we try to predict it us eq. (2) • second, instead of predict the valu of extrem  rate, we try to classifi them as either good or bad. for everi hotel we take the sequenc of report, and for each report (regardless of it valu) we classifi it as be good or bad howev, to perform these test, we need to estim the object valu, vf , that is the averag of the true qualiti observ, vi f . the algorithm we ar us is base on the intuit that the amount of conform rate is minim. in other word, the valu vf should be such that as often as possibl, bad rate follow expect abov vf and good rate follow expect below vf . formal, we defin the set: Γ1 = {i|ef (i) < vf and ri f ∈ b}; Γ2 = {i|ef (i) > vf and ri f ∈ g}; that correspond to irregular where even though the expect at point i is lower than the deliv valu, the rate is poor, and vice versa. we defin vf as the valu that minim these union of the two set: vf = arg min vf |Γ1 ∪ Γ2| (3) in eq. (2) we replac vi f by the valu vf comput in eq. (3), and us the follow distanc function: d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) = |vf − ef (i)| vf − ef (i) |vf 2 − ef (i)2 | · (1 + 2wi f ); the constant c ∈ i wa set to min{max{ef (i), 3}}, 4}. the valu for δf were fix at {0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6} for the  featur {overal, room, servic, cleanli, valu}  respect. the weight ar comput as describ in section 3. as a first experi, we take the set of extrem  rate {ri f |ri f /∈ i} for each hotel and featur. for everi such rate, ri f , we try to estim it by comput ˆri f us eq.
