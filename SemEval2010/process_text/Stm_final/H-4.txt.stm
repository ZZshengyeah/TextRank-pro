toward task-base person inform manag evalu david elsweil depart comput and inform scienc, univers of strathclyd dce@ci.strath.ac.uk ian ruthven depart comput and inform scienc, univers of strathclyd ir@ci.strath.ac.uk abstract person inform manag (pim) is a rapidli  grow area of research concern with how peopl store,  manag and re-find inform. a featur of pim research is that mani system have been design to assist user  manag and re-find inform, but veri few have been  evalu. thi ha been note by sever scholar and explain by the difficulti involv in perform pim evalu. the difficulti includ that peopl re-find inform from within uniqu person collect; research know littl about the task that caus peopl to re-find inform; and numer privaci issu concern person  inform. in thi paper we aim to facilit pim evalu by address each of these difficulti. in the first part, we present a diari studi of inform re-find task. the studi examin the kind of task that requir user to re-find inform and produc a taxonomi of re-find task for email messag and web page. in the second part, we propos a task-base evalu methodolog base on our find and examin the feasibl of the approach us two differ method of task creation. categori and subject descriptor h3.3 [inform search and retriev]: gener term measur,manag,experiment, human factor 1. introduct person inform manag (pim) is a rapidli  grow area of research concern with how peopl store,  manag and re-find inform. pim system - the method and procedur by which peopl handl, categor, and  retriev inform on a dai-to-dai basi [18] - ar  becom increasingli popular. howev the evalu of these pim system is problemat. on of the main difficulti is caus by the person natur of pim. peopl collect  inform as a natur consequ of complet other task. thi mean that the collect peopl gener ar uniqu to them alon and the inform within a collect is  intrins link with the owner"s person experi. as person collect ar uniqu, we cannot creat evalu task that ar applic to all particip in an evalu. secondli, person collect mai contain inform that the particip ar uncomfort share within an  evalu. the precis natur of thi inform - what  inform individu would prefer to keep privat - vari across individu make it difficult to base search task on the content of individu collect. therefor, experiment face a number of challeng in order to conduct realist but control pim evalu. a particular featur of pim research is that mani  system have been design to assist user with manag and re-find their inform, but veri few have been  evalu; a situat note by sever scholar [1, 6, 7]. recent, howev, research have start to focu on wai to  address the problem of pim evalu. for exampl, kelli [16] propos that numer methodolog must be taken to examin and understand the mani issu involv in pim, although, she make explicit refer to the need for  laboratori base pim studi and a common set of share task to make thi possibl. capra [6] also identifi the need for control pim lab evalu to complement other  evalu techniqu, place specif emphasi on the need to understand pim behaviour at the task level. in thi paper, we attempt to address the difficulti  involv to facili control laboratori pim evalu. in the first part of thi paper we present a diari studi of inform re-find task. the studi examin the kind of task that requir user to re-find inform and  produc a taxonomi of re-find task for email messag and web page. we also look at the featur of the task that make re-find difficult. in the second part, we propos a task-base evalu methodolog base on our find and examin the feasibl of the approach us differ method of task creation. thu, thi paper offer two  contribut to the field: an increas understand of pim behaviour at the task level and an evalu method that will facilit further investig. 2. relat work a varieti of approach ar avail to studi pim.  naturalist approach studi particip perform  natur, complet their own task as thei occur, within  familiar environ. these approach allow research to overcom mani of the difficulti caus by the person natur of pim. as the task perform ar real and not simul, the particip can utilis their own experi, previou knowledg and inform collect to complet the task. a benefit of the approach is that data can be captur continu over extend time period and  measur can be taken at fix point in time within these [15]. naturalist approach can be appli by  conduct fieldwork [17, 8], ethnograph method as suggest by [15] or via log file analysi [9, 7]. both ethnograph and fieldwork method requir the presenc of an experiment to assess how pim is perform, which rais a number of issu. firstli, evalu in thi wai is expens; take long time period to studi small number of particip and these small sampl mai not be repres of the behaviour of larger popul. secondli, becaus  particip cannot be continu observ, experiment must choos when to observ and thi mai affect the find. an altern strategi to conduct naturalist  evalu is to utilis log file analysi. thi approach make us of log softwar that captur a broad sampl of user activ in the context of natur us of a system. in [9] a novel pim search tool wa deploi to 234 user and the log data provid detail inform about the natur of user queri, interact with the queri interfac and about properti of the item retriev. log file analysi is a  power methodolog as it allow the captur of a larg quantiti of detail inform about how user behav with the system without the expens and distract influenc of an observ. nevertheless, there ar limit to thi  strategi. firstli, to attain us result, the deploi prototyp must be someth that peopl would us i.e. it ha to be a fulli function piec of softwar that offer improv on the system ordinarili avail to particip.  develop a research prototyp to thi standard is beyond the resourc of mani research. further, caution must be taken when analys log, as the captur data show  noth about the goal and intent that the user had at the time. it is, therefor, difficult to make ani concret  statement about the reason for the behaviour depict in the log. thi reveal a need to complement naturalist studi with control experi where the experiment can  relat the behaviour of studi particip to goal associ with known search task. laboratori-base studi simul user" real world environ in the control set of the laboratori,  offer the abil to studi issu that ar tightli defin and narrow in scope. on difficulti in perform thi kind of evalu is sourc collect to evalu. kelli [16]  propos the introduct of a share test collect that would provid sharabl, reusabl data set, task and metric for those interest in conduct pim research. thi mai be us for test algorithm in a wai similar to trec in mainstream ir [13]. howev, a share collect would be unsuit for user studi becaus it would not be  possibl to incorpor the person aspect of pim while us a common, unfamiliar collect. on altern approach is to ask user to provid their own inform collect to simul familiar environ within the lab. thi  approach ha been appli to studi the re-find of person photograph [11], email messag [20], and web-bookmark [21]. the us of thi approach depend on how easi it is to transfer the collect or gain remot access.  anoth solut is to us the entir web as a collect when studi web page re-find [4]. thi mai be appropri for studi web page re-find becaus previou studi have shown that peopl often us web search engin for thi purpos [5]. a second difficulti in perform pim laboratori  studi is creat task for particip to perform that can be solv by search a share or person collect. task relat to the activ that result in a need for inform [14] and ar acknowledg to be import in determin user behaviour [26]. a larg bodi of work ha been carri out to understand the natur of task and how the type of task influenc user inform seek behaviour. for  exampl, task have been categoris in term of increas complex [3] and task complex ha been suggest to affect how searcher perceiv their inform need [25] and how thei try to find inform [3]. other previou work ha provid methodolog that allow the simul of task when studi inform seek behaviour [2]. howev, littl is known about the kind of task that caus peopl to search their person store or re-find inform that thei have seen befor. consequ, it is difficult to devis simul work task situat for pim. the  except is the studi of person photograph manag, where rodden"s work on categoris person photograph search task ha facilit the creation of simul work task  situat [22]. there have been other suggest as to how to classifi pim task. for exampl, [5] ask particip to classifi task base on how frequent thei perform the task type in their daili life and how familiar thei were with the locat of the sought after inform and sever scholar have classifi inform object by the frequenc of their us e.g. [24]. while these ar interest properti that mai affect how a task will be perform, thei do not give experiment enough scope to devis task. person collect ar on reason why task creation is so difficult. rodden"s photo task taxonomi provid a solut here becaus it allow task, tailor to privat collect to be categoris. system can then be compar across task type for differ user [11]. unfortun, no  equival taxonomi exist for other type of inform object. further, other type of object ar more sensit to privaci than photograph; it is unlik that particip would be as content to allow research to brows their email  collect to creat task as thei were with photograph in [11]. thi present a seriou problem - how can research  devis task that correspond to privat collect without an understand of the kind of task peopl perform or  jeopardis the privaci of studi particip? a few method have been propos. for exampl, [20] studi email search by ask particip to re-find email that had been sent to everi member in a depart; allow the same task to be us for all of the studi particip. thi approach ensur that privaci issu were avoid and particip could us thing that thei rememb to complet task. nevertheless, the system were onli test us on type of task - particip were ask to find singl email, each of which share common properti. in section 4 we show that peopl perform a wider rang of email re-find task than thi. in [4], gener search task were artifici creat by run evalu over two session. in the first session, particip were ask to complet work task that involv find some unknown inform. in the second session, particip complet the same task again, which  natur involv some re-find behaviour. the limit of thi techniqu ar that it doe not allow particip to  exploit ani person connect with the inform becaus the inform thei ar look for mai not correspond to ani other aspect of their live. further, if time is utilis by a system or interfac be test the approach is unsuit becaus all of the object found in the first session will have been access within the same time period. our review of evalu approach motiv a  requir for control laboratori experi that allow tightli defin aspect of system or interfac to be test.  unfortun, it ha also been shown that there ar difficulti involv in perform thi type of evalu - it is difficult to sourc collect and to devis task that correspond to privat collect, while at the same time protect the  privaci of the studi particip. in the follow section we present a diari studi of  refind task for email and web page. the outcom is a classif of task similar to that devis by rodden for person photograph [22]. in section 5 we build on thi work by examin method for creat task that do not compromis the privaci of particip and discuss how our work can facilit task-base pim user evalu. we show that by collect task us electron diari, not onli can we learn about the task that caus peopl to re-find person inform, but we can learn about the content of privat collect without compromis the privaci of the particip. thi knowledg can then be us to construct task for us in pim evalu. 3. method diari studi ar a naturalist techniqu, offer the abil to captur factual data, in a natur set,  without the distract influenc of an observ. limit of the techniqu includ difficulti in maintain particip dedic level and convinc particip that seemingli mundan inform is us and should be report [19]. [12] suggest that the effect of the neg can be  limit, howev, with care design and good  implement. in our diari studi, we follow the suggest in [12] to achiev the best possibl data. to thi end, we restrict the record task to web and email re-find. by ask user to record fewer task it wa anticip that  particip apathi would be reduc and dedic level  maintain. the particip were provid with a personalis web form in which thei could record detail about their inform need and the context in which these need develop. web form were deploi rather than  paperbas diari becaus to re-find web and email inform the user would be at a comput with an internet  connect and there would be no need to search for a paper-base diari and pen. the diari form solicit the follow inform: whether the inform need relat to re-find a web page or an email messag and a descript of the task thei ar  perform. thi descript wa to contain both the  inform that the particip wish to find and the reason that thei need the inform. to help with thi, the form gave three exampl task descript, which were also  explain verbal to each particip dure an introductori session. the experiment ensur that the particip  understood that the task to be record were not limit to the type shown in the exampl. the exampl were  suppli pure to get particip think about the kind of thing thei could record and to show the level of and type of detail expect. the form also ask particip to rate each task in term of difficulti (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 wa veri easi and 5 wa veri hard). final, thei were ask when wa the last time thei look at the sought  after inform. again, thei were abl to choos from 5 option (less than a dai ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago). time inform wa us to examin the frequenc with which the particip re-found old and new inform, and when combin with difficulti rate creat a  pictur of whether or not the time period between access and re-access impact on how difficult the particip perceiv task to be. 36 particip, recruit by mass advertis through department commun channel, research group  meet and undergradu lectur, were ask to digit record detail of their inform re-find task over a period of approxim 3 week. the final popul  consist of 4 academ staff member, 8 research staff  member, 6 research student and 18 undergradu student. the ag of particip rang from 19-59. as both  person and work task were record, the result collect cover a broad rang of re-find task. 4. result sever analys were perform on the captur data. the follow section present the find. firstli, we  examin the kind of re-find task that were perform both when search on email and on the web. next, we consid the distribut of task - which kind of task were  perform most often by particip. lastli, we explor the kind of re-find task that particip perceiv as  difficult. 4.1 natur of web and email re-find task dure the studi 412 task were record. 150 (36.41%) of these task were email base, 262 (63.59%) were  webbas. as with most diari studi, the number of task record vari extens between particp. the  median number of task per particip wa 8 (interquartil rang (iqr)=9.5). more web task (median=5,iqr=7.5) were record than email task (median=3, iqr=3). thi mean that on averag each particip record  approxim on task everi two dai. from the descript suppli by the particip, we found similar featur in the record task for both email and web re-find. base on thi observ a joint  classif scheme wa devis, encompass both email and web task. the task were classifi as on of three type: lookup task, item task and multi-item task. lookup task involv search for specif inform from within a  resourc, for exampl an email or a web page, where the  resourc mai or mai not be known. some record exampl of lookup task were: • lu1: look for the cours code for a class - it"s us in a script that is run to set up a practic. i"d previous obtain thi about 3 week ago from our websit. • lu2: i am try to determin the date by which i step down as an extern examin. thi is in an email somewher • lu3: look for descript of log format from system r develop for student project. i think he sent me in it an email item task involv look for a particular email or web page, perhap to pass on to someon els or when the entir content ar need to complet the task. some record exampl of item task were: • i1: look for sigir 2002 paper to give to anoth student • i2: find the receipt of an onlin airlin purchas requir to claim expens • i3: i need the peer evalu form for the mia class e sent me them by email to clarifi, lookup task differ from item task in two wai - in the quantiti of inform requir and in what the user know about what thei ar look for. lookup task involv a need for a small piec of inform e.g. a phone number or an ingredi, and the user mai or mai not know exactli the resourc that contain thi inform. in item task the user know exactli the resourc thei ar look for and need the entir content of that resourc. multi-item task were task that requir inform that wa contain within numer web page or email  messag. often these task requir the user to process or collat the inform in order to solv the task. some record exampl were: • mi1: look for obituari and other materi on the novelist john fowl, who di at the weekend. access the onlin guradian and im • mi2: try to find detail on piccolo graphic framework. remind myself of what it is and what it doe. look to build a gui within eclips • mi3: i am try to file my email regard ipm and i am look for ani email from or about thi journal there were a number of task that were difficult to classifi. for exampl, consid the follow record task: • lu4: re-find as"s paper on grade relev assess  becaus i want to see how she present her result for a paper i am write thi task actual consist of two sub-task: 1 item  task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specif  inform within the paper). it wa decid to treat thi as a lookup task becaus the user"s ultim goal wa to access and us the inform within the resourc. there were a number of exampl of combin task, mainli of the form item then lookup, but there were also exampl of item then multi-item. for exampl: • mi4: re-find kelkoo websit so that i can re-check the price of hair-straighten for my girlfriend a second sourc of ambigu came from task such as find an email contain a url as a mean of re-access a web page. it wa also decid to categoris these as lookup task becaus in all case these were log by particip as email search and, within thi context, what thei were look for wa inform within an email. anoth problem wa that some of the log lack the detail requir to perform a categoris e.g. • u1: search for how to retriev user"s select from a  messag box. decid to us some other mean such task were label as u for unclassifi. to verifi the consist of the taxonomi, the task were  recategoris by the same research after a delai of two week. the agreement between the result of the two analys wa larg consist (96.8%). further, we ask a research with no knowledg of the project or the field to classifi a sampl of 50 task. the second research achiev a 90% agreement. we feel that thi high agreement on a larg  number of task by more than on research provid evid for the reliabl of the classif scheme. the distribut of task type is shown in tabl 1. overal, lookup and item task were the most common, with  multiitem task onli repres 8.98% of those record. the distribut of the task type wa differ for web and email re-find. the major of email task (60%) involv  look for inform within an email (lookup), in contrast to web task where the major of task (52.67%) involv look for a singl web page (item). anoth distinct wa the number of record multi-item task for web and email. multi-item task were veri rare for email re-find (onli 2.67% of email task involv search for multipl resourc), but compar common for web re-find (12.6%). lookup item multi-item unclass. email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) all 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) tabl 1: the distribut of task type in addit to the three-wai classif describ abov, the record task were classifi with respect to the  temperatur metaphor propos by [24], which classifi  inform as on of three temperatur: hot, warm and cold. we classifi the task us the form data. inform that had been seen less than a dai or less than a week  befor the task were defin as hot, inform that had been seen less than a month befor the task as warm, and  inform that had been seen less than a year or more than a year befor the task as cold. unfortun, a technic  difficulti with the form onli allow 335(81.3%) of the task to be classifi. the remaind were defin as u for  unclassifi. a cross-tabul of task type and temperatur is shown in tabl 2. hot warm cold unclass. email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) all 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) tabl 2: the distribut of temperatur most of the task that caus peopl to re-find web page (42.75%) and email messag (33.33%) involv search for inform that ha been access in the last week. howev there were also a number of re-find task that  involv search for older inform: 23.30% of the task record (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involv search for inform access in the last month and 18.69% of the task record (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were look for even older inform. thi is  import with respect to evalu becaus there is  psycholog evid suggest that peopl rememb less over time e.g. [23]. thi mean that user mai find search for older inform more difficult or perhap alter their  seek strategi when look for hot, warm or cold inform. 4.2 what task ar difficult? we look for pattern in the record data to determin if certain task were perceiv as more difficult than  other. for exampl, we examin whether the media type  affect how difficult the particip perceiv the task to be. there wa no evid that particip found either email (median=2 iqr=2) or web (median=2 iqr=2) task more difficult. we also investig whether the type of task or the length of time between access and re-access made a task more difficult. figur 1 show thi inform  graphic. figur 1: difficulti rate for task type from figur 1, it doe not appear that ani particular task type wa perceiv as difficult with respect to the other, although there is a suggest that lookup task were  perceiv more difficult when look for cold inform than hot and item task were perceiv more difficult for warm inform than hot. to assess the relationship between inform temperatur and the perceiv difficulti, we us mood"s median test to determin whether the rank of difficulti score wa in agreement for the inform temperatur be compar (p<0.05). for the look-up task data, there wa evid that hot task were perceiv easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm task were  perceiv easier than cold task(p=0.0041), but there wa no evid to distinguish between the difficulti rate of hot and warm task(p=0.593). for the item task data, there wa evid that hot and cold task were rate differ (p=0.024), but no evid to distinguish between hot and warm task(p=0.05) or warm and cold task(p=0.272). these test confirm that the length of time between  access and re-access the sought after inform inde influenc how difficult particip perceiv the task to be. nevertheless, the larg number of task of all type and temperatur rate by particip as easi i.e. < 3, suggest that there ar other factor that influenc how difficult a task is perceiv to be. to learn about these factor would  requir the kind of user evalu propos by [16, 6] - the kind of evalu facilit by our work. 4.3 summari in the first part of thi paper, we describ a diari studi of web and email re-find task. we examin the type of task that caus the particip to search their person store and found three main categori of task: task where the user requir specif inform from within a singl  resourc, task where a singl resourc is requir, and task that requir inform to be recov from multipl  resourc. it wa discov that look-up and item task were record with greater frequenc than multi-item task.  although no evid wa found that web or email task were more difficult, there wa some evid show that the time between access and re-access affect how  difficult the particip perceiv task to be. these find have implic for evalu pim behaviour at the task level. the remaind of thi paper concentr on thi,  discuss what the find mean with respect to perform task-base pim user evalu. 5. task-base pim evalu the find describ in section 4 ar us with  respect to evalu becaus thei provid experiment with enough knowledg to conduct control user evalu in lab condit. greco-latin squar experiment design can be construct where particip ar assign n task of the three type describ abov to perform on their own  collect us x system. thi would allow the perform of the system or the behaviour of the particip us  differ system to be analys with respect to the type of task be perform (look-up, item, or multi-item). in the  follow section we evalu the feasibl of thi approach when emploi differ method of task creation. 5.1 us real task on method of creat realist re-find task without compromis the privaci of particip is to us real task. diari-studi, similar to that describ abov, would allow experiment to captur a pool of task for particip to complet by search on their own collect. thi is extrem advantag becaus it would allow  experiment to evalu the behaviour of real user,  complet real search task on real collect while in a  control environ. there is also the addit benefit that the task descript would not make ani assumpt about what the user would rememb in a real life  situat becaus thei would onli includ the inform that had been record i.e. the inform that wa avail when the user origin perform the task. nevertheless, to gain these benefit we must, firstli, confirm that the task descript record ar of suffici qualiti to enabl the task to be re-perform at a later date. secondli, we must ensur that a diari-studi would provid experiment with enough task to construct a balanc experiment design that would satisfi their data need. to examin the qualiti of record task, 6 week after the diari studi had complet, we ask 6 of our  particip, select randomli from the pool of those who record enough task, to re-perform 5 of their own task. the task were select randomli from the pool of those avail. the issu task consist of 10 email and 20 web task, 9 of which were lookup task, 12 were item task, and 8 were multi-item task. the issu task repres a broad-sampl of the complet set of record task. thei also includ task with vagu descript e.g. • lu5:find a softwar kei for an applic i requir to  reinstal. • lu6:try to find a quot to us in a paper. cannot  rememb the person or the exact quot the us of such task would reli on the memori of particip i.e. would the record of task lu5 rememb which applic he refer to and would the record of lu6 rememb enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task? present with the task exactli as thei record them, the particip were ask to re-perform each task with ani system of their choic. of the 30 task issu, 26 (86.67%) were complet without problem, 2 (6.67%) of the task were not complet becaus the descript record wa insuffic to recreat the task, and 2 task (6.67%) were not complet becaus the task wa too difficult or the  requir web page no longer exist. experiment ar like to be interest in the final group of task becaus it is  import to discov what make a task difficult and how user behaviour chang in these circumst. therefor, from the 30 task test, onli 2 task were not of suffici  qualiti to be us in an evalu situat. further, there did not seem to be ani issu of the type, temperatur or  difficulti rate affect the qualiti of the task descript. these find suggest that the particip who record most task in the diari studi also record task with  suffici qualiti. howev, did the diari studi gener enough task to satisfi the need of experiment? particip task lookup item multi-item unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5

the number of system to be test etc. howev, for illustr purpos we chose 5 task as a cut-off point for our data. from tabl 3 and 4, which show the quantiti of email and web task record for each particip, we can see that of the 36 particip, onli 13 (36.1%) record 5 or more email task and 20 (55.6%) record 5 or more web task. thi mean that mani of the recruit particip could not actual particip in the final evalu. thi is a major limit of us record task in evalu becaus particip recruit for user test is challeng and it mai not be possibl to recruit enough particip if experiment lose between half and two-third of their popul. further, there wa some imbal in the number of record task of differ type. some particip record sever lookup task but veri few item task and other record sever item task but few lookup task. there wa also a specif lack of multi-item email task. thi  situat make it veri difficult for experiment to prepar balanc experiment design. therefor, even though our first test suggest that the qualiti of record task wa  suffici for the particip to re-perform the task at a later stage, the number of task record wa probabl too low to make thi a viabl option for experiment task creation. howev, it mai be possibl to increas the number of task record by frequent remind particip or by make person visit etc. 5.2 us simul task base on real task anoth benefit of diari-studi is that thei provid  inform about the content and us of privat  collect without invad particip" privaci. thi section explor the possibl of us a combin of the  knowledg gain from diari studi and other attribut known about particip to artifici creat re-find task  correspond to the taxonomi defin in section 4.1. we  explain the techniqu us and demonstr the feasibl of creat simul task within the context of a user  evalu investig email re-find behaviour. space  limit prevent us from report our find; instead we concentr on the method of task creation. as prepar for the evalu, we perform a  second diari-studi, where 34 new particip, consist of 16 post-graduat student and 18 under-graduat student, record 150 email task over a period of approxim 3 week. the collect data reveal sever pattern that help with the creation of artifici task. for exampl, student in both group record task relat to class that thei were take at the time and often differ  particip record task that involv search for the same inform. thi wa us becaus it provid us with a clue that even though some of the particip did not record a particular task, it wa possibl that the task mai still be applic to their collect. other pattern reveal  includ that student within the same group often search for email contain announc from the same sourc. for exampl, sever undergradu student record task that includ re-find inform relat to job  vacanc. there were also task that were record by  particip in both group. for exampl, search for an email that would re-confirm the pin code requir to access the comput lab. to supplement our knowledg of the particip" email collect, we ask 2 particip from each group to  provid email tour. these consist of short 5-10 minut  session, where particip were ask to explain why thei us email, who send them email, and their organis strategi. thi approach ha been us successfulli in the past as a non-intrus mean to learn about how peopl store and maintain their person inform [17].  origin, we had plan to ask more particip to provid tour, but we found 2 tour per group wa suffici for our need. again, pattern emerg that help with task creation. we found content overlap within and between group that confirm mani of our observ from the diari studi data. for exampl, the student who gave tour reveal that thei receiv email from lectur for  particular class assign, receipt for complet assign, and variou announc from system support and about job vacanc. importantli, the particip were also abl to confirm which other student had receiv the same  inform. thi confirm that mani of task record dure the diari studi were applic, not onli to the record, but to everi particip in 1 or both group. base on thi initi investigatori work, a set of 15 task (5 of each type in our taxonomi) wa creat for each group of particip. we also creat a set of task for a third group of particip that consist of research and  academ staff member, base on our knowledg of the email our colleagu receiv. where possibl we us the  inform record in the diari studi descript to provid a context for the task i.e. a work task or motiv that would requir the task to be perform. when the diari studi data did not provid suffici context inform to suppli the particip with a robust descript of the  inform need, we creat simul work task situat accord to the guidelin of [2]. a further advantag of us simul task in thi wai, rather than real-task, is that some of the user will not have perform the task in the recent past and thi allow the examin of task that look for inform of differ temperatur. if onli real-task had been us all of the particip would have perform the task dure the period of the diari studi. the creat task were us in a final evalu, where we examin the email re-find behaviour of user with three differ email system. 21 user (7 in each group) perform 9 task each (1 task of each type on each system) us their own person collect in a greco-latin squar experiment design. perform a pim evalu in thi wai allow the examin of re-find behaviour in a wai not possibl befor - we were abl to observ the email re-find strategi emploi by real user, perform  realist task, on their own collect in a control  environ. the studi reveal that the particip  rememb differ attribut of email, demostr differ find behaviour, and exhibit differ level of  perform when ask to complet task of the differ type in the taxonomi. the kei to both the task creation and the analysi of the result wa our taxonomi, which provid the templat to creat task and also a mean to compar the behaviour and perform of differ user (and system) perform differ task of the same type. some of the find of the evalu will be publish in [10]. summaris the approach, to conduct a user experi us our methodolog, research would be requir to perform the follow step: 1)conduct a diari studi as abov 1 . 2)analys the record task look for overlap between the particip. 3)supplement the gain  knowledg about the content of particip" collect by ask a select of the particip to provid a tour of their  collect. 4)us the knowledg gain to devis task of the three differ type defin within the taxonomi. more  de1 inform about thi and the diari form requir can be found at http://www.ci.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/pimevalu tail inform on how to us the research describ in thi paper to perform task-base pim evalu can be found at our websit (see footnot 1). 6. conclus thi paper ha focus on overcom the difficulti  involv in perform pim evalu. the person natur of pim mean that it is difficult to construct balanc  experi becaus particip each have their own uniqu collect that ar self-gener by complet other task. we suggest that to incorpor the person aspect of pim in evalu, the perform of system or user should be examin when user complet task on their own collect. thi approach itself ha problem becaus task creation for person collect is difficult: research don"t know much about the kind of re-find task peopl  perform and thei don"t know what inform is within  individu person collect. in thi paper we describ wai of overcom these challeng to facilit task base pim user evalu. in the first part of the paper we perform a diari studi that examin the task that caus peopl to re-find email messag and web page. the collect data includ a wide rang of both work and non-work relat task, and base on the data we creat a taxonomi of web and email re-find task. we discov that peopl perform three main type of re-find task: task that requir specif inform from within a singl resourc, task that requir a singl complet resourc, and task that requir inform to be recov from multipl resourc. in the second part of the paper, we discuss the signific of the taxonomi with respect to pim evalu. we demonstr that balanc experi could be conduct compar system or user perform on the task categori within the taxonomi. we also suggest two method of creat task that can be complet on person collect. these method do not compromis the privaci of studi particip. we  examin the techniqu suggest, firstli by simul an  experiment situat - particip were ask to re-perform their own task as thei record them, and secondli, in the context of a full evalu. perform evalu in thi wai will allow system that have been propos to improv user" abil to manag and re-find their inform to be test, so that we can learn about the need and desir of user. thu, thi paper ha offer two contribut to the field: an increas understand of pim behaviour at the task level and an evalu method that will facilit further investig. 7. acknowledg we
