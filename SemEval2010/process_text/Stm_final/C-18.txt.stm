histori began spread throughout the internet. within 10 minut after the first infect host (patient zero), 90 percent of all  vulner host had been compromis creat signific  disrupt to the global internet infrastructur. vern paxson of the intern comput scienc institut and lawrenc berkelei nation laboratori in it analysi of slammer comment: the slammer worm spread so quickli that  human respons wa ineffect, see [4] the interest part, from our perspect, about the spread of slammer is that it wa a rel unsophist worm with benign behavior, name self-reproduct. sinc slammer, research have explor the behavior of fast spread worm, and have design countermeasur strategi base primarili on rate detect and limit algorithm. for exampl, zou, et al., [2], propos a scheme where a kalman filter is us to  detect the earli propag of a worm. other research have propos the us of detector where rate of  destin unreach messag ar monitor by firewal, and a signific increas beyond normal, alert the  organ to the potenti presenc of a worm. howev, such strategi suffer from the fight the last war syndrom. that is, system ar be design and develop to  effect contain worm whose behavior ar similar to that of slammer. in the work describ here, we put forth the  hypothesi that next gener worm will be differ, and  therefor such techniqu mai have some signific limit. specif, we propos to studi a new gener of worm call swarm worm, whose behavior is predic on the concept of emerg intellig. the concept of emerg intellig wa first studi in associ with biolog system. in such studi, earli research discov a  varieti of interest insect or anim behavior in the wild. a flock of bird sweep across the sky. a group of ant forag for food. a school of fish swim, turn, flee  togeth awai from a predat, and so forth. in gener, thi kind of aggreg motion ha been call swarm  behavior. biologist, and comput scientist in the field of  artifici intellig have studi such biolog swarm, and 323 attempt to creat model that explain how the element of a swarm interact, achiev goal, and evolv. moreov, in recent year the studi of swarm intellig ha becom increasingli import in the field of robot, the design of mobil ad-hoc network (manet), the design of  intrus detect system, the studi of traffic pattern in transport system, in militari applic, and other area, see [3]. the basic concept that have been develop over the last decad to explain swarm, and swarm behavior includ four basic compon. these ar: 1. simplic of logic & action: a swarm is compos of n agent whose intellig is limit. agent in the swarm us simpl local rule to govern their action. some model call thi primit action or behavior; 2. local commun mechan: agent interact with other member in the swarm via simpl local commun mechan. for exampl, a bird in a flock sens the posit of adjac bird and appli a simpl rule of avoid and follow. 3. distribut control: autonom agent interact with their environ, which probabl consist of other agent, but act rel independ from all other agent. there is no central command or leader, and certainli there is no global plan. 4. emerg intellig: aggreg behavior of  autonom agent result in complex intellig  behavior; includ self-organ. in order to understand fulli the behavior of such swarm it is necessari to construct a model that explain the  behavior of what we will call gener worm. thi model, which extend the work by weaver [5] is present here in section 2. in addit, we intend to extend said model in such a wai that it clearli explain the behavior of thi new class of potenti danger worm call swarm worm. swarm worm behav veri much like biolog swarm and exhibit a high degre of learn, commun, and distribut intellig. such swarm worm ar potenti more  harm than their similar gener counterpart. specif, the first instanc, to our knowledg, of such a learn worm wa creat, call zachik. zachik is a simpl password  crack swarm worm that incorpor differ learn and inform share strategi. such a swarm worm wa  deploi in both a local area network of thirti-(30) host, as well as simul in a 10,000 node topolog. preliminari result show that such worm ar capabl of  compromis host at rate up to two order of magnitud faster than their gener counterpart. the rest of thi manuscript is structur as follow. in section 2 an abstract model of both gener worm as well as swarm worm is present. thi model is us in section 2.6 to describ the first instanc of a swarm worm, zachik. in section 4, preliminari result via both empir measur as well as simul is present. final, in section 5 our conclus and insight into futur work ar present. 2. worm model in order to studi the behavior of swarm worm in gener, it is necessari to creat a model that realist reflect the structur of worm and it is not necessarili ti to a specif instanc. in thi section, we describ such a model where a gener worm is describ as have four-(4) basic compon or subfunct. by definit, a worm is a  selfcontain, self propag program. thu, in simpl term, it ha two main function: that which propag and that which doe other thing. we propos that there is a third broad function of a worm, that of self-preserv. we also propos that the other function of a worm mai be more appropri categor as goal-base action (gba), as whatev function includ in a worm will natur be depend on whatev goal (and subgoal) the author ha. the work present by weaver et. al. in [5] provid us with mainli an action and techniqu base taxonomi of comput worm, which we util and further extend here. 2.1 propag the propag function itself mai be broken down into three action: acquir target, send scan, and infect target. acquir the target simpli mean pick a host to attack next. send a scan involv check to see if that host is recept to an infect attempt, sinc ip-space is spars popul. thi mai involv a simpl ping to check if the host is aliv or a full out vulner assess. infect the target is the actual method us to send the worm code to the new host. in algorithm form: propag() { host := acquir_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } in the case of a simpl worm which doe not first check to see if the host is avail or suscept (such as slammer), the scan method is drop: propag() { host := acquir_target() infect(host) } each of these action mai have an associ cost to it inclus and execut, such as increas worm size and cpu or network load. depend on the author need or requir, these becom limit factor in what mai be includ in the worm"s action. thi is discuss further after expand upon these action below. 2.2 target acquisit: the target acquisit phase of our worm algorithm is built directli off of the target discoveri section in [5]. weaver et. al. taxonom thi task into 5 separ categori. here, we further extend their work through parameter. scan: scan mai be consid an equat-base method for choos a host. ani type of equat mai be us to arriv at an ip address, but there ar three main type seen thu far: sequenti, random, and local  prefer. sequenti scan is exactli as it sound: start at an ip address and increment through all the ip space. thi could carri with it the option of which ip to start with (user chosen valu, random, or base on ip of infect host) and 324 how mani time to increment (continu, chosen valu, or subnet-base). random scan is complet at random (depend on the chosen prng method and it seed valu). local prefer scan is a varianc of either sequenti or random, wherebi it ha a greater probabl of  choos a local ip address over a remot on (for exampl, the tradit 80/20 split). pre-gener target list: pre-gener target list, or so call hit-list, could includ the option for  percentag of total popul and percentag wrong, or just  number of ip to includ. implicit to thi type is the fact that the list is divid among a parent and it children, avoid the problem of everi instanc hit the exact same machin. extern gener target list: extern  gener target list depend on on or more extern sourc that can be queri for host data. thi will involv either server that ar normal publicli avail, such as game meta-server, or on explicitli setup by the worm or worm author. the normal avail meta-server could have  paramet for rate of chang, such as mani pop up at night or leav in the morn. each server could also have a maximum queri/second that it would be abl to handl. the worm would also need a wai of find these server, either hard-code or through scan. intern target list: intern target list ar highli depend on the infect host. thi method could  parameter the choic of how much info is on the host, such as all machin in subnet, all window box in subnet,  particular server, number of intern/extern, or some  combin. passiv: passiv method ar determin by normal interact between host. paramet mai includ a rate of interact with particular machin, intern/extern rate of interact, or subnet-base rate of interact. ani of these method mai also be combin to produc differ type of target acquisit strategi. for exampl, the a worm mai begin with an initi hit-list of 100 differ host or subnet. onc it ha exhaust it search us the hit-list, it mai then proce to perform random scan with a 50% local bia. it is import to note, howev, that the resourc  consumpt of each method is not the same. differ method mai requir the worm to be larg, such as the extra byte  requir by a hit-list, or to take more process time, such as by search the host for address of other vulner host. further research and analysi should be perform in thi area to determin associ cost for us each method. the cost could then be us in determin design  tradeoff that worm author engag at. for exampl, hit list provid a high rate of infect, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 send a scan the send scan function test to see if the host is avail for infect. thi can be as simpl as check if the host is up on the network or as complex as check if the host is vulner to the exploit which will be us. the send of a scan befor attempt infect can increas‘ the scan rate if the cost for fail an infect is greater than the cost of fail a scan or send a scan plu infect; and failur ar more frequent than success. on import paramet to thi would be the choic of transport protocol (tcp/udp) or just simpli the time for on success scan and time for on fail scan. also, whether or not it test for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulner (or for multipl vulner). 2.2.2 infect vector (iv) the particular infect vector us to access the remot host is mainli depend on the particular vulner  chosen to exploit. in a non-specif sens, it is depend on the transport protocol chosen to us and the messag size to be sent. section 3 of [5] also propos three particular class of iv: self-carri, second channel, and embed. 2.3 self preserv the self preserv action of a worm mai take mani form. in the wild, worm have been observ to disabl anti-viru softwar or prevent send itself to certain  antivirusknown address. thei have also been seen to attempt  disabl of other worm which mai be contend for the same system. we also believ that a time-base throttl  scan mai help the worm to slip under the radar. we also propos a decoi method, wherebi a worm will releas a few children that caus a lot of nois so that the parent is not notic. it ha also been propos [5] that a worm caus damag to it host if, and onli if, it is disturb in some wai. thi modul could contain paramet for: probabl of success in disabl anti-viru or other softwar updat, probabl of be notic and thu remov, or  harden of the host against other worm. 2.4 goal-base action a worm"s gba function depend on the author"s goal list. the payload section of [5] provid some us  suggest for such a modul. the open of a back-door can make the host suscept to more attack. thi would  involv a probabl of the back-door be us and ani  associ traffic util. it could also provid a list of other worm thi host is now suscept to or a list of  vulner thi host now ha. spam relai and http-proxi of cours have an associ bandwidth consumpt or traffic pattern. internet do attack would have a set time of  activ, a target, and a traffic pattern. data damag would have an associ probabl that the host di becaus of the damag. in figur 1, thi gener model of a worm is summar. pleas note that in thi model there is no learn, no, or veri littl, share of inform between worm instanc, and certainli no coordin of action. in the next  section we expand the model to includ such mechan, and henc, arriv at the gener model of a swarm worm. 2.5 swarm - gener model as describ in section 1, the basic characterist that distinguish swarm behavior from simpli what appear to be collect coordin behavior ar four basic attribut. these ar: 1. simplic of logic & action; 2. local commun mechan; 3. distribut control; and 4. emerg intellig, includ self-organ. 325 structur function/exampl infect, infect vector execut is run protect & stealthi disabl mcafe (stai aliv) propag send email to everyon in address book goal base action (gba) ddo www.sco.com everyth els, often call payload figur 1: gener worm model in thi work we aggreg all of these attribut under the gener titl of learn, commun, and  distribut control. the presenc of these attribut  distinguish swarm worm from otherwis regular worm, or other type of malwar such as zombi. in figur ??, the gener model of a worm is expand to includ these set of action. within thi context then, a worm like slammer cannot be categor as a swarm worm due to the fact that new  instanc of the worm do not coordin their action or share inform. on the other hand, zombi and mani other form of ddo, which at first glanc mai be consid swarm worm ar not. thi is simpli due to fact that in the case of zombi, control is not distribut but rather central, and no emerg behavior aris. the latter, the potenti emerg of intellig or new behavior is what make swarm worm so potenti danger. final, when on consid the major of recent disrupt to the  internet infrastructur, and in light of our descript of swarm attack, then said disrupt can be easili categor as precursor to truli swarm behavior. specif, • ddo - larg number of compromis host send  useless packet requir process (stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnot/in − 99 − 04.html). ddo attack ar the earli precursor to swarm  attack due to the larg number of agent involv. • code red crv1, code red ii, nimbda - exhibit earli notion of swarm attack, includ a backdoor  commun channel. • staniford & paxson in how to own the internet in your spare time? explor modif to crv1, code red i, ii with a swarm like type of  behavior. for exampl, thei specul on new worm which emploi direct worm-to-worm commun, and  emploi programm updat. for exampl the warhol worm, and permut-scan (self coordin) worm. 2.6 swarm worm: the detail in consid the creation of what we believ to be the first swarm worm in exist, we want to adher as close as possibl to the gener model present in section ?? while at the same time facilit larg scale analysi, both empir and through simul, of the behavior of the swarm. for thi reason, we select as the first instanc structur function/exampl infect, infect vector execut is run protect & stealthi disabl mcafe (stai aliv) propag send email to everyon in address book learn, commun, pheromon/flag (test and distribut control if worm is alreadi present) time bomb, learn algorithm, irc channel goal base action (gba) ddo www.sco.com everyth els, often call payload figur 2: gener model of a swarm worm of the swarm a simpl password crack worm. the  object of thi worm simpli is to infect a host by sequenti attempt to login into the host us well known  password (dictionari attack), password that have been  discov previous by ani member of the swarm, and random password. onc, a host is infect, the worm will creat commun channel with both it known neighbor at that time, as well as with ani offspr that it  successfulli gener. in thi context a success gener of an offspr mean simpli infect a new host and replic an exact copi of itself in such a host. we call thi swarm worm the zachik worm in honor of on of it creator. as it can be seen from thi descript, the zachik worm  exhibit all of the element describ befor. in the follow section, we describ in detail each on of the element of the zachik worm. 2.7 infect vector the infect vector us for zachik worm is the secur shell protocol ssh. a modifi client which is capabl of  receiv password from the command line wa written, and integr with a script that suppli it with variou  password: known and random. when a password is found for an appropri target, the infect process begin. after the root password of a host is discov, the worm infect the target host and replic itself. the worm creat a new directori in the target host, copi the modifi ssh client, the script, the commun server, and the  updat version of data file (list of known password and a list of current neighbor). it then run the modifi script on the newli infect host, which spawn the  commun server, notifi the neighbor and start look for new target. it could be argu, correctli, that the zachik worm can be easili defeat by current countermeasur techniqu present on most system todai, such as disallow direct root login from the network. within thi context zachik can quickli be discard as veri simpl and harmless worm that doe not requir further studi. howev, the reader should  consid the follow: 1. zachik can be easili modifi to includ a varieti of  infect vector. for exampl, it could be program to guess common user name and their password; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or us other well know vulner to gain root privileg; 2. zachik is a proof of concept worm. the import of zachik is that it incorpor all of the behavior of a swarm worm includ, but not restrict to,  distribut control, commun amongst agent, and learn; 3. zachik is compos of a larg collect of agent  oper independ which lend itself natur to parallel algorithm such as a parallel search of the ipv4 address space. within thi context, slammer, doe incorpor a parallel search capabl of  potenti suscept address. howev, unlik zachik, the knowledg discov by the search is never share amongst the agent. for thi reason, and mani other, on should not discard the potenti of thi new class of worm but rather embrac it studi. 2.8 self-preserv in the case of zachik worm, the main self-preserv techniqu us ar simpli keep the payload small. in thi context, thi simpli mean restrict the number of password that an offspr inherit, masquerad worm messag as common http request, and restrict the  number of neighbor to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 propag choos the next target(s) in an effici matter requir thought. in the past, known and propos worm, see [5], have appli propag techniqu that vari. these  includ: strictli random select of a potenti vulner host; target list of vulner host; local bias random select (select a host target at random from a local  subnet); and a combin of some or all of the abov. in our test and simul environ, we will appli a  combin of local bias and total random select of potenti vulner host. howev, due to the fact that the zachik worm is a swarm worm, address discoveri (that is when non-exist address ar discov) inform will be share amongst member of the swarm. the infect and propag thread do the follow set of activ repeatedli: • choos an address • check the valid of the address • choos a set of password • try infect the select host with thi set of  password as describ earlier, choos an address make us of a combin of random select, local bia, and target list. specif, to choos an address, the instanc mai either: • gener a new random address • gener an address on the local network • pick an address from a handoff list the choic is made randomli among these option, and can be vari to test the depend of propag on  particular choic. password ar either chosen from the list of known password or newli gener. when an infect of a valid address fail, it is ad to a list of handoff, which is sent to the neighbor to try to work on. 2.10 learn, communicationanddistribut control 2.10.1 commun the concept of a swarm is base on transfer of  inform amongst neighbor, which relai their new incom messag to their neighbor, and so on until everi worm  instanc in the swarm is awar of these messag. there ar two class of messag: data or inform messag and command. the command messag ar meant for an  extern user (a.k.a., hacker and/or cracker) to control the action of the instanc, and ar current not implement. the inform messag ar current of three kind: new member, password and exploit address (handoff). the new member messag ar messag that a new instanc send to the neighbor on it (short) list of initi neighbor. the neighbor then regist these instanc in their neighbor list. these ar messag that form the multi-connect of the swarm, and without them, the topolog will be a  treelik structur, where elimin a singl node would caus the instanc beneath it to be inaccess. the password messag inform instanc of newli discov password, and by inform all instanc, the swarm as whole collect thi inform, which allow it to infect new instanc more effect. the handoff messag inform instanc of valid address that could not be compromis (fail at break the password for the root account). sinc the  address space is rather spars, it take a rel long time (i.e. mani trial) to discov a valid address. therefor, by hand off discov valid address, the swarm is (a)  conserv energi by not re-discov the same address (b) attack more effect. in a wai, thi is a simpl instanc of coordin activ of a swarm. 2.10.2 coordin when a worm instanc is born, it relai it exist to all neighbor on it list. the main thread then spawn a few infect thread, and continu to handl incom messag (regist neighbor, ad new password,  receiv address and relai these messag). 2.10.3 distribut control control in the zachik worm is distribut in the sens that each instanc of the worm perform a set of action  independ of everi other instanc while at the same time benefit from the learn achiev by it immedi  neighbor. 2.11 goal base action the first instanti of the zachik worm ha two basic goal. these ar: (1) propag, and (2) discov and share with member of th swarm new root password. 3. experiment design in order to verifi our hypothesi that swarm worm ar more capabl, and therefor danger than other well known 327 worm, a network testb wa creat, and a simul, capabl of simul larg scale internet-like topolog (ipv4 space), wa develop. the network testb  consist of a local area network of 30 linux base comput. the simul wa written in c++ . the simpl swarm worm describ in section 2.6 wa us to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm wa allow to propag via it own mechan of propag, distribut control, and swarm behavior. in the case of a simpl local area network of 30  comput, six-(6) differ root password out of a password space of 4 digit (10000 option) were select. at the start of the experi a singl known password is known, that of patient-zero. all share password ar distribut randomli across all node. similarli, in the case of the simul, a network topolog of 10,000 host, whose address were  select randomli across the ipv4 space, wa construct. within that space, a total of 200 share password were  select and distribut either randomli and/or target to specif network topolog subnet. for exampl, in on of our simul run, the network topolog consist of 200 subnet each contain 50 host. in such a topolog, share password were distribut across subnet where a vari percentag of password were share across subnet. the percentag of share password us wa reflect of earli empir studi, where up to 39.7% of common password were found to be share. 4. result in figur 3, the result compar swarm attack behavior versu that of a typic malform worm for a 30 node lan ar present. in thi set of empir run, six-(6) share password were distribut at random across all node from a possibl of 10,000 unknown password. the data present reflect the behavior of a total of three-(3) distinct class of worm or swarm worm. the class of worm present ar as follow: • i-ns-nl:= gener worm, independ (i), no  learn/memoryless (nl), and no share of inform with neighbor or offspr (ns); • s-l-sp:= swarm worm (s), learn (l), keep list of learn password, and share of password (sp) across nearest neighbor and offspr; and • s-l-sp&a:= swarm worm (s), learn (l), keep list of learn password, and share of password and  exist address (sp&a) across nearest neighbor and offspr. as it is shown in figur 3, the result valid our origin hypothesi that swarm worm ar significantli more effici and danger than gener worm. in thi set of  experi, the share of password provid an order of  magnitud improv over a memoryless random worm.  similarli, a swarm worm that share password and address is approxim two order of magnitud more effici than it gener counterpart. in figur 3, a seri of discontinu can be observ. these discontinu ar an artifact of the small sampl space us for thi experi. basic, as soon as a  password is broken, all node share that specif password ar infect within a few second. note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discov a small share password space. in figur 4, the simul result compar swarm  attack behavior versu that of a gener malform worm ar present. in thi set of simul run, a network  topolog of 10,000 host, whose address were select randomli across the ipv4 space, wa construct. within that space, a total of 200 share password were select and distribut either randomli and/or target to specif network  topolog subnet. the data present reflect the behavior of three-(3) distinct class of worm or swarm worm and  two(2) differ target host select scan strategi  (random scan and local bia). the amount of local bia wa vari across multipl simul run. the result  present ar aggreg behavior. in gener the follow class of gener worm and swarm worm were simul. address scan: • random:= address ar select at random from a subset of the ipv4 space, name, a 224 address space; and • local bia:= address ar select at random from either a local subnet (256 address) or from a subset of the ipv4 space, name, a 224 address space. the percentag of local bia is vari across multipl run. learn, commun & distribut control • i-nl-ns: gener worm, independ (i), no learn/ memoryless (nl), and no share of inform with neighbor or offspr (ns); • i-l-oo: gener worm, independ (i), learn/ memoryless (l), and on time share of inform with offspr onli (oo); • s-l-sp:= swarm worm (s), learn (l), keep list of learn password, and share of password (sp) across nearest neighbor and offspr; • s-l-s&aop:= swarm worm (s), learn (l), keep list of learn password, and share of address with neighbor and offspr, share password on time onli (at creation) with offspr(sa&op); • s-l-sp&a:= swarm worm (s), learn (l), keep list of learn password, and share of password and  exist address (sp&a) across nearest neighbor and offspr. as it is shown in figur 4, the result ar consist with our set of empir result. in addit, the follow  observ can be made. 1. local prefer is incred effect. 2. short address handoff ar more effect than long on. we vari the size of the list allow in the share of address; the overhead associ with a long address list is detriment to the perform of the swarm worm, as well as to it stealthi; 3. for the local bia case, share valid address of  suscept host, s-l-s&aop worm (recal, the s-l-s&aop swarm share password, on time onli, with offspr 328 at creation time) is more effect than share  password in the case of the s-l-sp swarm. in thi case, we can think of the swarm as launch a  distributeddictionari attack: differ segment of the swarm us differ password to try to break into suscept  uninfect host. in the local bia mode, earli in the life of the swarm, address-share is more effect than password-share, until most subnet ar discov. then the target of local address assist in  discov the suscept host, while the swarm member need to wast time rediscov password; and 4. infect the last 0.5% of node take a veri long time in non-local bia mode. basic, the share password list across subnet ha been exhaust, and the swarm revert to simpli a random discoveri of password  algorithm. figur 3: swarm attack behavior vs. malform worm: empir result, 30node lan figur 4: swarm attack behavior vs. malform worm: simul result 5. summari and futur work in thi manuscript, we have present an abstract model, similar in some aspect to that of weaver [5], that help explain the gener natur of worm. the model present in section 2 wa extend to incorpor a new class of  potenti danger worm call swarm worm. swarm worm behav veri much like biolog swarm and exhibit a high degre of learn, commun, and distribut intellig. such swarm worm ar potenti more  harm than their gener counterpart. in addit, the first instanc, to our knowledg, of such a learn worm wa creat, call zachik. zachik is a  simpl password crack swarm worm that incorpor  differ learn and inform share strategi. such a swarm worm wa deploi in both a local area network of thirti-(30) host, as well as simul in a 10,000 node  topolog. preliminari result show that such worm is capabl of compromis host a rate up to 2 order of magnitud faster than it gener counterpart while retain stealth capabl. thi work open up a new area of interest problem. some of the most interest and press problem to be consid ar as follow: • is it possibl to appli some of learn concept  develop over the last ten year in the area of swarm intellig, agent system, and distribut control to the design of sophist swarm worm in such a wai that true emerg behavior take place? • ar the current techniqu be develop in the  design of intrus
