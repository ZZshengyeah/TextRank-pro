bid optim in concurr second-price auction of perfectli substitut good enrico h. gerd, rajdeep k. dash, david c. k. yuen and nichola r. jen univers of southampton, southampton, so17 1bj, uk. {eg,rkd,dy,nrj}@ec.soton.ac.uk abstract we deriv optim bid strategi for a global bid agent that particip in multipl, simultan second-price auction with perfect substitut. we first consid a model where all other bidder ar local and particip in a singl auction. for thi case, we prove that, assum free  dispos, the global bidder should alwai place non-zero bid in all avail auction, irrespect of the local bidder"  valuat distribut. furthermor, for non-decreas valuat distribut, we prove that the problem of find the  optim bid reduc to two dimens. these result hold both in the case where the number of local bidder is known and when thi number is determin by a poisson distribut. thi analysi extend to onlin market where, typic,  auction occur both concurr and sequenti. in addit, by combin analyt and simul result, we  demonstr that similar result hold in the case of sever global bidder, provid that the market consist of both global and local bidder. final, we address the effici of the overal market, and show that inform about the number of  local bidder is an import determin for the wai in which a global bidder affect effici. categori and subject descriptor i.2.11 [distribut artifici intellig]: multiag system; j.4 [social and behavior scienc]: econom gener term econom 1. introduct the recent surg of interest in onlin auction ha result in an increas number of auction offer veri similar or even ident good and servic [9, 10]. in ebai alon, for exampl, there ar often hundr or sometim even  thousand of concurr auction run worldwid sell such substitut item1 . against thi background, it is essenti to develop bid strategi that autonom agent can us to oper effect across a wide number of auction. to thi end, in thi paper we devis and analys optim  bid strategi for an import yet bare studi set - name, an agent that particip in multipl,  concurr (i.e., simultan) second-price auction for good that ar perfect substitut. as we will show, howev, thi  analysi is also relev to a wider context where auction ar conduct sequenti, as well as concurr. to date, much of the exist literatur on multipl  auction focus either on sequenti auction [6] or on  simultan auction for complementari good, where the valu of item togeth is greater than the sum of the individu item (see section 2 for relat research on simultan auction). in contrast, here we consid bid strategi for market with multipl concurr auction and perfect substitut. in particular, our focu is on vickrei or second-price seal bid auction. we choos these becaus thei requir littl commun and ar well known for their capac to  induc truth bid, which make them suitabl for mani multi-agent system set. howev, our result generalis to set with english auction sinc these ar strateg equival to second-price auction. within thi set, we ar abl to characteris, for the first time, a bidder"s  utilitymaximis strategi for bid simultan in ani  number of such auction and for ani type of bidder valuat  distribut. in more detail, we first consid a market where a singl bidder, call the global bidder, can bid in ani number of auction, wherea the other bidder, call the local  bidder, ar assum to bid onli in a singl auction. for thi case, we find the follow result: • wherea in the case of a singl second-price auction a bidder"s best strategi is to bid it true valu, the best strategi for a global bidder is to bid below it. • we ar abl to prove that, even if a global bidder  requir onli on item, the expect util is maximis by particip in all the auction that ar sell the desir item. • find the optim bid for each auction can be an  arduou task when consid all possibl combin. howev, for most common bidder valuat  distribut, we ar abl to significantli reduc thi search space and thu the comput requir. • empir, we find that a bidder"s expect util is maximis by bid rel high in on of the auction, and equal or lower in all other auction. we then go on to consid market with more than on global bidder. due to the complex of the problem, we combin analyt result with a discret simul in order to  numer deriv the optim bid strategi. by so do, we find that, in a market with onli global bidder, the  dynam of the best respons do not converg to a pure  strategi. in fact it fluctuat between two state. if the market consist of both local and global bidder, howev, the global bidder" strategi quickli reach a stabl solut and we approxim a symmetr nash equilibrium. the remaind of the paper is structur as follow.  section 2 discuss relat work. in section 3 we describ the bidder and the auction in more detail. in section 4 we  investig the case with a singl global bidder and characteris the optim bid behaviour for it. section 5 consid the case with multipl global bidder and in section 6 we address the market effici. final, section 7 conclud. 2. relat work research in the area of simultan auction can be  segment along two broad line. on the on hand, there is the game-theoret and decis-theoret analysi of  simultan auction which concentr on studi the equilibrium strategi of ration agent [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11]. such  analys ar typic us when the auction format emploi in the concurr auction is the same (e.g. there ar m  vickrei auction or m first-price auction). on the other hand, heurist strategi have been develop for more complex set when the seller offer differ type of auction or the buyer need to bui bundl of good over distribut  auction [1, 13, 5]. thi paper adopt the former approach in studi a market of m simultan vickrei auction sinc thi approach yield provabl optim bid strategi. in thi case, the semin paper by engelbrecht-wiggan and weber provid on of the start point for the  gametheoret analysi of distribut market where buyer have substitut good. their work analys a market  consist of coupl have equal valuat that want to bid for a dresser. thu, the coupl"s bid space can at most contain two bid sinc the husband and wife can be at most at two geograph distribut auction simultan. thei  deriv a mix strategi nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyer is larg. our analysi differ from their in that we studi concurr auction in which bidder have differ valuat and the global bidder can bid in all the auction concurr (which is entir possibl given autonom agent). follow thi, [7] then studi the case of simultan auction with complementari good. thei analys the case of both local and global bidder and characteris the bid of the buyer and result market effici. the set provid in [7] is further extend to the case of common valu in [9]. howev, neither of these work extend easili to the case of substitut good which we consid. thi case is studi in [12], but the scenario consid is restrict to three seller and two global bidder and with each bidder have the same valu (and therebi know the valu of other bidder). the space of symmetr mix equilibrium strategi is deriv for thi special case, but again our result is more gener. final, [11] consid the case of concurr english auction, in which he develop bid algorithm for buyer with differ risk attitud. howev, he forc the bid to be the same across auction, which we show in thi paper not alwai to be optim. 3. bid in multipl auction the model consist of m seller, each of whom act as an auction. each seller auction on item; these item ar complet substitut (i.e., thei ar equal in term of valu and a bidder obtain no addit benefit from win more than on item). the m auction ar execut concurr; that is, thei end simultan and no inform about the outcom of ani of the auction becom avail until the bid ar place2 . howev, we briefli address market with both sequenti and concurr auction in section 4.4. we also assum that all the auction ar equival (i.e., a bidder doe not prefer on auction over anoth). final, we assum free dispos (i.e., a winner of multipl item incur no addit cost by discard unwant on) and risk neutral bidder. 3.1 the auction the seller"s auction is implement as a vickrei auction, where the highest bidder win but pai the second-highest price. thi format ha sever advantag for an agent-base set. firstli, it is commun effici. secondli, for the singl-auction case (i.e., where a bidder place a bid in at most on auction), the optim strategi is to bid the true valu and thu requir no comput (onc the valuat of the item is known). thi strategi is also weakli domin (i.e., it is independ of the other bidder" decis), and therefor it requir no inform about the prefer of other agent (such as the distribut of their valuat). 3.2 global and local bidder we distinguish between global and local bidder. the former can bid in ani number of auction, wherea the latter onli bid in a singl on. local bidder ar assum to bid accord to the weakli domin strategi and bid their true valuat3 . we consid two wai of model local bidder: static and dynam. in the first model, the number of local bidder is assum to be known and equal to n for each auction. in the latter model, on the other hand, the averag number of bidder is equal to n, but the exact number is unknown and mai vari for each auction. thi uncertainti is model us a poisson distribut (more detail ar provid in section 4.1). as we will later show, a global bidder who bid optim ha a higher expect util compar to a local bidder, even though the item ar complet substitut and a bidder onli requir on of them. howev, we can identifi a number of compel reason why not all bidder would choos to bid global. firstli, particip cost such as entri fee and time to set up an account mai encourag occasion user to 2 although thi paper focus on seal-bid auction, where thi is the case, the condit ar similar for last-minut bid in english auction such as ebai [10]. 3 note that, sinc bid the true valu is optim for local bidder irrespect of what other ar bid, their strategi is not affect by the presenc of global bidder. 280 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) particip in auction that thei ar alreadi familiar with. secondli, bidder mai simpli not be awar of other auction sell the same type of item. even if thi is known,  howev, addit inform such as the distribut of the valuat of other bidder and the number of particip bidder is requir for bid optim across multipl  auction. thi lack of expert inform often drive a novic to bid local. thirdli, an optim global strategi is harder to comput than a local on. an agent with bound  ration mai therefor not have the resourc to comput such a strategi. lastli, even though a global bidder profit on averag, such a bidder mai incur a loss when inadvert win multipl auction. thi deter bidder who ar  either risk avers or have budget constraint from particip in multipl auction. as a result, in most market place we expect a combin of global and local bidder. in view of the abov consider, human buyer ar more like to bid local. the global strategi, howev, can be effect execut by autonom agent sinc thei can gather data from mani auction and perform the requir calcul within the desir time frame. 4. a singl global bidder in thi section, we provid a theoret analysi of the  optim bid strategi for a global bidder, given that all other bidder ar local and simpli bid their true valuat.  after we describ the global bidder"s expect util in  section 4.1, we show in section 4.2 that it is alwai optim for a global bidder to particip in the maximum number of auction avail. in section 4.3 we discuss how to  significantli reduc the complex of find the optim bid for the multi-auction problem, and we then appli these method to find optim strategi for specif exampl. final, in section 4.4 we extend our analysi to sequenti auction. 4.1 the global bidder"s expect util in what follow, the number of seller (auction) is m ≥ 2 and the number of local bidder is n ≥ 1. a bidder"s valuat v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomli drawn from a cumul  distribut f with probabl densiti f, where f is continu, strictli posit and ha support [0, vmax]. f is assum to be equal and common knowledg for all bidder. a global bid b is a set contain a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ m (the bid mai be differ for differ auction). for eas of exposit, we introduc the cumul  distribut function for the first-order statist g(b) = f(b)n ∈ [0, 1], denot the probabl of win a specif auction condit on place bid b in thi auction, and it  probabl densiti g(b) = dg(b)/db = nf(b)n−1 f(b). now, the expect util u for a global bidder with global bid b and valuat v is given by: u(b, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈b (1 − g(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈b bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) here, the left part of the equat is the valuat  multipli by the probabl that the global bidder win at least on of the m auction and thu correspond to the expect benefit. in more detail, note that 1 − g(bi) is the probabl of not win auction i when bid bi, bi∈b(1 − g(bi)) is the probabl of not win ani  auction, and thu 1 − bi∈b(1 − g(bi)) is the probabl of win at least on auction. the right part of equat 1 correspond to the total expect cost or payment. to see the latter, note that the expect payment of a singl  secondpric auction when bid b equal b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independ of the expect payment for other auction. clearli, equat 1 appli to the model with static local  bidder, i.e., where the number of bidder is known and equal for each auction (see section 3.2). howev, we can us the same equat to model dynam local bidder in the  follow wai: lemma 1 by replac the first-order statist g(y) with ˆg(y) = en(f (y)−1) , (2) and the correspond densiti function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆg(y)/dy = n f(y)en(f (y)−1) , equat 1 becom the  expect util where the number of local bidder in each  auction is describ by a poisson distribut with averag n (i.e., where the probabl that n local bidder particip is given by p(n) = nn e−n /n!). proof to prove thi, we first show that g(·) and f(·) can be modifi such that the number of bidder per auction is given by a binomi distribut (where a bidder"s decis to particip is given by a bernoulli trial) as follow: g (y) = f (y)n = (1 − p + p f (y))n , (3) where p is the probabl that a bidder particip in the auction, and n is the total number of bidder. to see thi, note that not particip is equival to bid zero. as a result, f (0) = 1 − p sinc there is a 1 − p probabl that a bidder bid zero at a specif auction, and f (y) = f (0) + p f(y) sinc there is a probabl p that a bidder bid accord to the origin distribut f(y). now, the averag number of particip bidder is given by n = p n. by replac p with n/n, equat 3 becom g (y) = (1 − n/n + (n/n)f(y))n . note that a poisson distribut is given by the limit of a binomi distribut. by keep n constant and take the limit n → ∞, we then obtain g (y) = en(f (y)−1) = ˆg(y). thi conclud our proof. the result that follow appli to both the static and dynam model unless state otherwis. 4.2 particip in multipl auction we now show that, for ani valuat 0 < v < vmax, a  utilitymaximis global bidder should alwai place non-zero bid in all avail auction. to prove thi, we show that the  expect util increas when place an arbitrarili small bid compar to not particip in an auction. more formal, theorem 1 consid a global bidder with valuat 0 < v < vmax and global bid b, where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ b. suppos b contain no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}, then there exist a bj > 0 such that u(b∪{bj }, v) > u(b, v). proof us equat 1, the margin expect util for particip in an addit auction can be written as: u(b ∪ {bj }, v) − u(b, v) = vg(bj ) bi∈b (1 − g(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy now, us integr by part, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjg(bj)− bj 0 g(y)dy and the abov equat can be rewritten as: u(b ∪ {bj }, v) − u(b, v) = g(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈b (1 − g(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 g(y)dy (4) the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 281 let bj = , where is an arbitrarili small strictli posit valu. clearli, g(bj) and bj 0 g(y)dy ar then both strictli posit (sinc f(y) > 0). moreov, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ b and that v > 0, it follow that v bi∈b(1 − g(bi)) > 0. now, suppos bj = 1 2 v bi∈b(1 − g(bi)), then u(b ∪ {bj }, v) − u(b, v) = g(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈b(1 − g(bi)) + bj 0 g(y)dy > 0 and thu u(b ∪ {bj }, v) > u(b, v). thi complet our proof. 4.3 the optim global bid a gener solut to the optim global bid requir the  maximis of equat 1 in m dimens, an arduou task, even when appli numer method. in thi section,  howev, we show how to reduc the entir bid space to two  dimens in most case (on continu, and on discret), therebi significantli simplifi the problem at hand. first, howev, in order to find the optim solut to equat 1, we set the partial deriv to zero: ∂u ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈b\{bi} (1 − g(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) now, equal 5 hold either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈b\{bi}(1 − g(bj ))v − bi = 0. in the dynam model, g(bi) is alwai greater than zero, and can therefor be  ignor (sinc g(0) = nf(0)e−n and we assum f(y) > 0). in the static model, g(bi) = 0 onli when bi = 0.  howev, theorem 1 show that the optim bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax. therefor, we can ignor the first part, and the second part yield: bi = v bj ∈b\{bi} (1 − g(bj)) (6) in other word, the optim bid in auction i is equal to the bidder"s valuat multipli by the probabl of not  win ani of the other auction. it is straightforward to show that the second partial deriv is neg, confirm that the solut is inde a maximum when keep all other bid constant. thu, equat 6 provid a mean to deriv the optim bid for auction i, given the bid in all other auction. 4.3.1 reduc the search space in what follow, we show that, for non-decreas  probabl densiti function (such as the uniform and logarithm distribut), the optim global bid consist of at most two differ valu for ani m ≥ 2. that is, the search space for find the optim bid can then be reduc to two  continu valu. let these valu be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow. more formal: theorem 2 suppos the probabl densiti function f is non-decreas within the rang [0, vmax], then the follow proposit hold: given v > 0, for ani bi ∈ b, either bi = bhigh, bi = blow, or bi = bhigh = blow. proof us equat 6, we can produc m equat, on for each auction, with m unknown. now, by combin these equat, we obtain the follow relationship: b1(1 − g(b1)) = b2(1 − g(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − g(bm)). by defin h(b) = b(1 − g(b)) we can rewrit the equat to: h(b1) = h(b2) = . . . = h(bm) = v bj ∈b (1 − g(bj )) (7) in order to prove that there exist at most two differ bid, it is suffici to show that b = h−1 (y) ha at most two solut that satisfi 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax for ani y. to see thi, suppos h−1 (y) ha two solut but there exist a third bid bj = blow = bhigh. from equat 7 it then follow that there exist a y such that h(bj) = h(blow) = h(bhigh) = y. therefor, h−1 (y) must have at least three solut, which is a contradict. now, note that, in order to prove that h−1 (y) ha at most two solut, it is necessari and suffici to show that h(b) ha at most on local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax. a  suffici condit, howev, is for h(b) to be strictli concav4 . the function h is strictli concav if and onli if the follow condit hold: h (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − g(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where h (b) = d2 h/db2 . by perform standard  calcul, we obtain the follow condit for the static model: b (n − 1) f(b) f(b) + n f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarli for the dynam model we have: b n f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db. sinc both f and f ar posit, condit 9 and 10 clearli hold for f (b) ≥ 0. in other word, condit 9 and 10 show that h(b) is strictli  concav when the probabl densiti function is non-decreas for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, complet our proof. note from condit 9 and 10 that the requir of non-decreas densiti function is suffici, but far from necessari. moreov, condit 8 requir h(b) to be strictli concav is also stronger than necessari to guarante onli two solut. as a result, in practic we find that the reduct of the search space appli to most case. given there ar at most 2 possibl bid, blow and bhigh, we can further reduc the search space by express on bid in term of the other. suppos the buyer place a bid of blow in mlow auction and bhigh for the remain mhigh = m−mlow auction, equat 6 then becom: blow = v(1 − g(blow))mlow−1 (1 − g(bhigh))mhigh , and can be rearrang to give: bhigh = g−1 1 − blow v(1 − g(blow))mlow−1 1 mhigh (11) here, the invers function g−1 (·) can usual be obtain quit easili. furthermor, note that, if mlow = 1 or mhigh = 1, equat 6 can be us directli to find the desir valu. us the abov, we ar abl to reduc the bid search space to a singl continu dimens, given mlow or mhigh.  howev, we do not know the number of auction in which to bid blow and bhigh, and thu we need to search m differ  combin to find the optim global bid. moreov, for each 4 more precis, h(b) can be either strictli convex or strictli concav. howev, it is easi to see that h is not convex sinc h(0) = h(vmax) = 0, and h(b) ≥ 0 for 0 < b < vmax. 282 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 0 0.5 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 valuat (v) bidfract(x) 0 0.5 1 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 local

addit, for comparison, the dark solid line in the right figur depict the expect  util when bid local in a randomli select  auction, given there ar no global bidder (note that, in case of local bidder onli, the expect util is not affect by m). combin, the optim blow and bhigh can vari.  therefor, in order to find the optim bid for a bidder with  valuat v, it is suffici to search along on continu variabl blow ∈ [0, v], and a discret variabl mlow = m − mhigh ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. 4.3.2 empir evalu in thi section, we present result from an empir studi and characteris the optim global bid for specif case. furthermor, we measur the actual util improv that can be obtain when us the global strategi. the result present here ar base on a uniform distribut of the  valuat with vmax = 1, and the static local bidder model, but thei generalis to the dynam model and other distribut (not shown due to space limit). figur 1 illustr the optim global bid and the correspond expect  util for variou m and n = 5, but again the bid curv for differ valu of m and n follow a veri similar pattern. here, the bid is normalis by the valuat v to give the bid fraction x = b/v. note that, when x = 1, a bidder bid it true valu. as shown in figur 1, for bidder with a rel low valuat, the optim strategi is to submit m equal bid at, or veri close to, the true valu. the optim bid fraction then gradual decreas for higher valuat. interestingli, in most case, place equal bid is no longer the optim strategi after the valuat reach a certain point. a  socal pitchfork bifurc is then observ and the optim bid split into two valu: a singl high bid and m − 1 low on. thi transit is smooth for m = 2, but exhibit an abrupt jump for m ≥ 3. in all experi, howev, we consist observ that the optim strategi is alwai to place a high bid in on auction, and an equal or lower bid in all other. in case of a bifurc and when the valuat approach vmax, the optim high bid goe to the true valu and the low bid go to zero. as illustr in figur 1, the util of a global bidder  becom progress higher with more auction. in absolut term, the improv is especi high for bidder that have an abov averag valuat, but not too close to vmax. the bidder in thi rang thu benefit most from bid global. thi is becaus bidder with veri low valuat have a veri small chanc of win ani auction, wherea bidder with a veri high valuat have a high probabl of win a singl auction and benefit less from particip in more auction. in contrast, if we consid the util  rel to bid in a singl auction, thi is much higher for bidder with rel low valuat (thi effect cannot be seen clearli in figur 1 due to the scale). in particular, we notic that a global bidder with a low valuat can improv it util by up to m time the expect util of bid local. intuit, thi is becaus the chanc of win on of the auction increas by up to a factor m, wherea the increas in the expect cost is neglig. for high valuat buyer, howev, the benefit is not that obviou becaus the chanc of win ar rel high even in case of a singl auction. 4.4 sequenti and concurr auction in thi section we extend our analysi of the optim bid strategi to sequenti auction. specif, the auction  process consist of r round, and in each round ani number of auction ar run simultan. such a combin of sequenti and concurr auction is veri common in  practic, especi onlin5 . it turn out that the analysi for the case of simultan auction is quit gener and can be easili extend to includ sequenti auction. in the  follow, the number of simultan auction in round r is denot by mr, and the set of bid in that round by br. as befor, the analysi assum that all other bidder ar local and bid in a singl auction. furthermor, we assum that the global bidder have complet knowledg about the number of round and the number of auction in each round. the expect util in round r, denot by ur, is similar to befor (equat 1 in section 4.1) except that now addit benefit can be obtain from futur auction if the desir item is not won in on of the current set of simultan auction. for conveni, ur(br, mr) is abbrevi to ur in the follow. the expect util thu becom: ur = v · pr(br) − bri∈br bri 0 yg(y)dy + ur+1 · (1 − pr(br)) = ur+1 + (v − ur+1)pr(br) − bri∈br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where pr(br) = 1 − bri∈br (1 − g(bri)) is the probabl of win at least on auction in round r. now, we take the partial deriv of equat 12 in order to find the optim bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − us+1) bri∈br\{brj } (1 − g(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 rather than be pure sequenti in natur, onlin  auction also often overlap (i.e., new auction can start while other ar still ongo). in that case, howev, it is optim to wait and bid in the new auction onli after the outcom of the earlier auction is known, therebi reduc the chanc of unwittingli win multipl item. us thi strategi, overlap auction effect becom sequenti and can thu be analys us the result in thi section. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 283 note that equat 13 is almost ident to equat 5 in section 4.3, except that the valuat v is now replac by v−ur+1. the optim bid strategi can thu be found by backward induct (where ur+1 = 0) us the procedur outlin in section 4.3. 5. multipl global bidder as argu in section 3.2, we expect a real-world market to exhibit a mix of global and local bidder. wherea so far we assum a singl global bidder, in thi section we consid a set where multipl global bidder interact with on  anoth and with local bidder as well. the analysi of thi problem is complex, howev, as the optim bid  strategi of a global bidder depend on the strategi of other global bidder. a typic analyt approach is to find the  symmetr nash equilibrium solut [9, 12], which occur when all global bidder us the same strategi to produc their bid, and no (global) bidder ha ani incent to unilater  deviat from the chosen strategi. due to the complex of the problem, howev, here we combin a comput  simul approach with analyt result. the simul work by iter find the best respons to the optim  bid strategi in the previou iter. if thi should result in a stabl outcom (i.e., when the optim bid  strategi remain unchang for two subsequ iter), the solut is by definit a (symmetr) nash equilibrium. 5.1 the global bidder"s expect util in order to find a global bidder"s best respons, we first need to calcul the expect util given the global bid b and the strategi of both the other global bidder as well as the local bidder. in the follow, let ng denot the number of other global bidder. furthermor, let the strategi of the other global bidder be repres by the set of function βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ m, produc a bid for each auction given a bidder"s valuat v. note that all other global bidder us the same set of function sinc we consid symmetr  equilibria. howev, we assum that the assign of function to auction by each global bidder occur in a random fashion without replac (i.e., each function is assign exactli onc by each global bidder). let Ω denot the set of all  possibl assign. each such assign ω ∈ Ω is a (m, ng) matrix, where each entri ωi,j identifi the function us by global bidder j in auction i. note that the cardin of Ω, denot by |Ω|, is equal to m!ng . now, the expect util is the averag expect util over all possibl assign and is given by: u(b, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈b (1 − ˜gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈b bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜gωi (b) = g(b) · ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denot the probabl of win auction i, given that each global  bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ ng bid accord to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜gωi (y)/dy. here, g(b) is the probabl of  win an auction with onli local bidder as describ in  section 4.1, and f(y) is the probabl densiti of the bidder valuat as befor. 5.2 the simul the simul work by discretis the space of possibl valuat and bid and then find a best respons to an initi set of bid function. the best respons is found by maximis equat 14 for each discret valuat, which, in turn, result in a new set of bid function. these  function then affect the probabl of win in the next  iter for which the new best respons strategi is calcul. thi process is then repeat for a fix number of iter or until a stabl solut ha been found6 . clearli, due to the larg search space, find the  utilitymaximis global bid quickli becom infeas as the  number of auction and global bidder increas. therefor, we reduc the search space by limit the global bid to two dimens where a global bidder bid high in on of the auction and low in all the other7 . thi simplif is justifi by the result in section 4.3.1 which show that, for a larg number of commonli us distribut, the optim global bid consist of at most two differ valu. the result report here ar base on the follow  set.8 in order to emphas that the valuat ar  discret, we us integ valu rang from 1 to 1000. each valuat occur with equal probabl, equival to a  uniform valuat distribut in the continu case. a  bidder can select between 300 differ equal-space bid  level. thu, a bidder with valuat v can place bid b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}. the local bidder ar static and bid their valuat as befor. the initi set of function can plai an import role in the experi. therefor, to  ensur our result ar robust, experi ar repeat with differ random initi function. 5.3 the result first, we describ the result with no local bidder. for thi case, we find that the simul doe not converg to a stabl state. that is, when there is at least on other global bidder, the best respons strategi keep fluctuat, irrespect of the number of iter and of the initi state. the  fluctuat, howev, show a distinct pattern and altern between two state. figur 2 depict these two state for ng = 10 and m = 5. the two state vari most when there ar at least as mani auction as there ar global bidder. in that case, on of the best respons state is to bid truthfulli in on auction and zero in all other. the best respons to that, howev, is to bid an equal posit amount close to zero in all  auction; thi strategi guarante at least on object at a veri low payment. the best respons is then again to bid  truthfulli in a singl auction sinc thi appropri the object in that particular auction. as a result, there exist no stabl solut. the same result is observ when the number of global bidder is less than the number of auction. thi  oc6 thi approach is similar to an altern-move  bestrespons process with pure strategi [4], although here we consid symmetr strategi within a set where an  oppon"s best respons depend on it valuat. 7 note that the number of possibl alloc still increas with the number of auction and global bid. howev, by merg all util-equival permut, we significantli increas comput speed, allow experi with  rel larg number of auction and bidder to be perform (e.g., a singl iter with 50 auction and 10 global bidder take roughli 30 second on a 3.00 ghz pc). 8 we also perform experi with differ precis, other valuat distribut, and dynam local bidder. we find that the prinicip conclus generalis to these  differ set, and therefor we omit the result to avoid repetit. 284 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent

fluctuat is observ when the number of global bidder increas rel to the number of auction. howev, the bid in the equal-bid state (state 2 in figur 2), as well as the low bid of the other state, increas. moreov, if the number of global bidder is increas even further, a bifurc occur in the equal-bid state similar to the case without local bidder. we now consid the best respons strategi when both  local and global bidder particip and each auction contain the same number of local bidder. to thi end, figur 3 show the averag varianc of the best respons strategi. thi is measur as the varianc of an actual best-respons bid over differ iter, and then take the averag over the discret bidder valuat. here, the varianc is a gaug for the amount of fluctuat and thu the instabl of the strategi. as can be seen from thi figur, local bidder have a larg stabilis effect on the global bidder strategi. as a result, the best respons strategi approxim a pure  symmetr nash equilibrium. we note that the result converg after onli a few iter. the result show that the princip conclus in the case of a singl global bidder carri over to the case of multipl global bidder. that is, the optim strategi is to bid  posit in all auction (as long as there ar at least as mani  bidder as auction). furthermor, a similar bifurc point is observ. these result ar veri robust to chang to the auction set and the paramet of the simul. to conclud, even though a theoret analysi prove  difficult in case of sever global bidder, we can approxim a (symmetr) nash equilibrium for specif set us a discret simul in case the system consist of both local and global bidder. thu, our simul can be us as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the  optim bid strategi for practic set where we expect a combin of local and global bidder. 6. market effici effici is an import system-wide properti sinc it  characteris to what extent the market maximis social welfar (i.e. the sum of util of all agent in the market). to thi end, in thi section we studi the effici of market with either static or dynam local bidder, and the impact that a global bidder ha on the effici in these market.  specif, effici in thi context is maximis when the bidder with the m highest valuat in the entir market obtain a singl item each. more formal, we defin the effici of an alloc as: definit 1 effici of alloc. the effici ηk of an alloc k is the obtain social welfar proport to the maximum social welfar that can be achiev in the market and is given by: ηk = nt i=1 vi(k) nt i=1 vi(k∗) , (15) where k∗ = arg maxk∈k nt i=1 vi(k) is an effici  alloc, k is the set of all possibl alloc, vi(k) is bidder i"s util for the alloc k ∈ k, and nt is the total  number of bidder particip across all auction (includ ani global bidder). now, in order to measur the effici of the market and the impact of a global bidder, we run simul for the market with the differ type of local bidder. the  experi ar carri out as follow. each bidder"s valuat is drawn from a uniform distribut with support [0, 1]. the local bidder bid their true valuat, wherea the global bidder bid optim in each auction as describ in  section 4.3. the experi ar repeat 5000 time for each run to obtain an accur mean valu, and the final  averag result and standard deviat ar taken over 10 run in order to get statist signific result. the result of these experi ar shown in figur 4. note that a degre of ineffici is inher to a  multiauct market with onli local bidder [2].9 for exampl, if there ar two auction sell on item each, and the two bidder with the highest valuat both bid local in the same auction, then the bidder with the second-highest valu doe not obtain the good. thu, the alloc of item to bidder is ineffici. as can be observ from figur 4,  howev, the effici increas when n becom larger. thi is becaus the differ between the bidder with the  highest valuat becom smaller, therebi decreas the loss of effici. furthermor, figur 4 show that the presenc of a global bidder ha a slightli posit effect on the effici in case the local bidder ar static. in the case of dynam bidder, howev, the effect of a global bidder depend on the number of seller. if m is low (i.e., for m = 2), a global bidder  significantli increas the effici, especi for low valu of 9 trivial except ar when either m = 1 or n = 1 and  bidder ar static, sinc the market is then complet effici without a global bidder. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 285 2 4 6 8 10 12 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 m local bidder

effect  becom even more pronounc for higher valu of m). thi result is explain as follow. the introduct of a global bidder potenti lead to a decreas of effici sinc thi bidder can unwittingli win more than on item. howev, as the number of local bidder increas, thi is less like to happen. rather, sinc the global bidder increas the  number of bidder, it presenc make an overal posit (albeit small) contribut in case of static bidder. in a market with dynam bidder, howev, the market effici depend on two other factor. on the on hand, the effici increas sinc item no longer remain unsold (thi situat can  occur in the dynam model when no bidder turn up at an auction). on the other hand, as a result of the uncertainti concern the actual number of bidder, a global bidder is more like to win multipl item (we confirm thi  analyt). as m increas, the first effect becom neglig wherea the second on becom more promin, reduc the effici on averag. to conclud, the impact of a global bidder on the effici clearli depend on the inform that is avail. in case of static local bidder, the number of bidder is known and the global bidder can bid more accur. in case of  uncertainti, howev, the global bidder is more like to win more than on item, decreas the overal effici. 7. conclus in thi paper, we deriv util-maximis strategi for  bid in multipl, simultan second-price auction. we first analys the case where a singl global bidder bid in all auction, wherea all other bidder ar local and bid in a singl auction. for thi set, we find the counter-intuit result that it is optim to place non-zero bid in all auction that sell the desir item, even when a bidder onli requir a singl item and deriv no addit benefit from have more. thu, a potenti buyer can achiev consider  benefit by particip in multipl auction and emploi an optim bid strategi. for a number of common  valuat distribut, we show analyt that the problem of find optim bid reduc to two dimens. thi  consider simplifi the origin optimis problem and can thu be us in practic to comput the optim bid for ani number of auction. furthermor, we investig a set with multipl global bidder by combin analyt solut with a simul approach. we find that a global bidder"s strategi doe not stabilis when onli global bidder ar present in the market, but onli converg when there ar local bidder as well. we argu, howev, that real-world market ar like to contain both local and global bidder. the converg result ar then veri similar to the set with a singl global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefit by bid optim in multipl auction. for the more complex set with multipl global bidder, the simul can thu be us to find these bid for specif case. final, we compar the effici of a market with  multipl concurr auction with and without a global bidder. we show that, if the bidder can accur predict the number of local bidder in each auction, the effici slightli increas. in contrast, if there is much uncertainti, the effici  significantli diminish as the number of auction increas due to the increas probabl that a global bidder win more than two item. these result show that the wai in which the effici, and thu social welfar, is affect by a global bidder depend on the inform that is avail to that global bidder. in futur work, we intend to extend the result to imperfect substitut (i.e., when a global bidder gain from win addit item), and to set where the auction ar no longer ident. the latter aris, for exampl, when the number of (averag) local bidder differ per auction or the auction have differ set for paramet such as the reserv price. 8. refer [1] s. airiau and s. sen. strateg bid for multipl unit in simultan and sequenti auction. group decis and negoti, 12(5):397-413, 2003.
