[1]. howev, thi approach onli consid page visit statist independ of each other, not take into account the page" rel posit on post-queri brows path. radlinski and joachim [13] have util such collect user intellig to improv retriev accuraci by us sequenc of consecut queri reformul, yet their approach doe not consid user" interact beyond the search result page. in thi paper, we present a user studi of a techniqu that exploit the search and brows behavior of mani user to suggest popular web page, refer to as destin henceforth, in addit to the regular search result. the destin mai not be among the  toprank result, mai not contain the queri term, or mai not even be index by the search engin. instead, thei ar page at which other user end up frequent after submit same or similar queri and then brows awai from initi click search result. we conjectur that destin popular across a larg number of user can captur the collect user experi for inform need, and our result support thi hypothesi. in prior work, o"dai and jeffri [12] identifi teleport as an inform-seek strategi emploi by user jump to their previous-visit inform target, while anderson et al. [2] appli similar principl to support the rapid navig of web site on mobil devic. in [19], wexelblat and mae describ a system to support within-domain navig base on the brows trail of other user. howev, we ar not awar of such principl be appli to web search. research in the area of recommend system ha also address similar issu, but in area such as question-answer [9] and rel small onlin commun [16]. perhap the nearest instanti of teleport is search engin" offer of sever within-domain shortcut below the titl of a search result. while these mai be base on user behavior and possibl site structur, the user save at most on click from thi featur. in contrast, our propos approach can transport user to locat mani click beyond the search result, save time and give them a broader perspect on the avail relat inform. the conduct user studi investig the effect of includ link to popular destin as an addit interfac featur on search engin result page. we compar two variant of thi approach against the suggest of relat queri and unaid web search, and seek answer to question on: (i) user prefer and search effect for known-item and exploratori search task, and (ii) the prefer distanc between queri and destin us to identifi popular destin from past behavior log. the result indic that suggest popular destin to user attempt exploratori task provid best result in kei aspect of the inform-seek experi, while provid queri refin suggest is most desir for known-item task. the remaind of the paper is structur as follow. in section 2 we describ the extract of search and brows trail from user activ log, and their us in identifi top destin for new queri. section 3 describ the design of the user studi, while section 4 and 5 present the studi find and their discuss, respect. we conclud in section 6 with a summari. 2. search trail and destin we us web activ log contain search and brows activ collect with permiss from hundr of thousand of user over a five-month period between decemb 2005 and april 2006. each log entri includ an anonym user identifi, a timestamp, a uniqu browser window identifi, and the url of a visit web page. thi inform wa suffici to reconstruct tempor order sequenc of view page that we refer to as trail. in thi section, we summar the extract of trail, their featur, and destin (trail end-point). in-depth descript and analysi of trail extract ar present in [20]. 2.1 trail extract for each user, interact log were group base on browser identifi inform. within each browser instanc, particip navig wa summar as a path known as a browser trail, from the first to the last web page visit in that browser. locat within some of these trail were search trail that origin with a queri submiss to a commerci search engin such as googl, yahoo!, window live search, and ask. it is these search trail that we us to identifi popular destin. after origin with a queri submiss to a search engin, trail proce until a point of termin where it is assum that the user ha complet their inform-seek activ. trail must contain page that ar either: search result page, search engin homepag, or page connect to a search result page via a sequenc of click hyperlink. extract search trail us thi methodolog also goe some wai toward handl multi-task, where user run multipl search concurr. sinc user mai open a new browser window (or tab) for each task [18], each task ha it own browser trail, and a correspond distinct search trail. to reduc the amount of nois from page unrel to the activ search task that mai pollut our data, search trail ar termin when on of the follow event occur: (1) a user return to their homepag, check e-mail, log in to an onlin servic (e.g., myspac or del.ico.us), type a url or visit a bookmark page; (2) a page is view for more than 30 minut with no activ; (3) the user close the activ browser window. if a page (at step i) meet ani of these criteria, the trail is assum to termin on the previou page (i.e., step i - 1). there ar two type of search trail we consid: session trail and queri trail. session trail transcend multipl queri and termin onli when on of the three termin criteria abov ar satisfi. queri trail us the same termin criteria as session trail, but also termin upon submiss of a new queri to a search engin. approxim 14 million queri trail and 4 million session trail were extract from the log. we now describ some trail featur. 2.2 trail and destin analysi tabl 1 present summari statist for the queri and session trail. differ in user interact between the last domain on the trail (domain n) and all domain visit earlier (domain 1 to (n - 1)) ar particularli import, becaus thei highlight the wealth of user behavior data not captur by log of search engin interact. statist ar averag for all trail with two or more step (i.e., those trail where at least on search result wa click). tabl 1. summari statist (mean averag) for search trail. measur queri trail session trail number of uniqu domain 2.0 4.3 total

statist suggest that user gener brows far from the search result page (i.e., around 5 step), and visit a rang of domain dure the cours of their search. on averag, user visit 2 uniqu (non search-engin) domain per queri trail, and just over 4 uniqu domain per session trail. thi suggest that user often do not find all the inform thei seek on the first domain thei visit. for queri trail, user also visit more page, and spend significantli longer, on the last domain in the trail compar to all previou domain combin.1 these distinct of the last domain in the trail mai indic user interest, page util, or page relev.2 2.3 destin predict for frequent queri, most popular destin identifi from web activ log could be simpli store for futur lookup at search time. howev, we have found that over the six-month period cover by our dataset, 56.9% of queri ar uniqu, and 97% queri occur 10 or fewer time, account for 19.8% and 66.3% of all search respect (these number ar compar to those report in previou studi of search engin queri log [15,17]). therefor, a lookup-base approach would prevent us from reliabl suggest destin for a larg fraction of search. to overcom thi problem, we util a simpl term-base predict model. as discuss abov, we extract two type of destin: queri destin and session destin. for both destin type, we obtain a corpu of queri-destin pair and us it to construct term-vector represent of destin that is analog to the classic tf.idf document represent in tradit ir [14]. then, given a new queri q consist of k term t1…tk, we identifi highest-score destin us the follow similar function: 1 independ measur t-test: t(~60m) = 3.89, p < .001 2 the topic relev of the destin wa test for a subset of around ten thousand queri for which we had human judgment. the

divis. the averag ag of subject wa 34.9 year (max=62, min=27, sd=6.2). all ar familiar with web search, and conduct 7.5 search per dai on averag (sd=4.1). thirti-on subject (86.1%) report gener awar of the queri refin offer by commerci web search engin. 3.4 task sinc the search task mai influenc inform-seek behavior [4], we made task type an independ variabl in the studi. we construct six known-item task and six open-end, exploratori task that were rotat between system and subject as describ in the next section. figur 3 show exampl of the two task type. known-item task identifi three tropic storm (hurrican and typhoon) that have caus properti damag and/or loss of life. exploratori task you ar consid purchas a voic over internet protocol (voip) telephon. you want to learn more about voip technolog and provid that offer the servic, and select the provid and telephon that best suit you. figur 3. exampl of known-item and exploratori task. exploratori task were phrase as simul work task situat [5], i.e., short search scenario that were design to reflect real-life inform need. these task gener requir subject to gather background inform on a topic or gather suffici inform to make an inform decis. the known-item search task requir search for particular item of inform (e.g., activ, discoveri, name) for which the target wa  welldefin. a similar task classif ha been us successfulli in previou work [21]. task were taken and adapt from the text retriev confer (trec) interact track [7], and question pose on question-answer commun (yahoo! answer, googl answer, and window live qna). to motiv the subject dure their search, we allow them to select two known-item and two exploratori task at the begin of the experi from the six possibl for each categori, befor see ani of the system or have the studi describ to them. prior to the experi all task were pilot test with a small number of differ subject to help ensur that thei were compar in difficulti and select (i.e., the likelihood that a task would be chosen given the altern). post-hoc analysi of the distribut of task select by subject dure the full studi show no prefer for ani task in either categori. 3.5 design and methodolog the studi us a within-subject experiment design. system had four level (correspond to the four experiment system) and search task had two level (correspond to the two task type). system and task-type order were counterbalanc accord to a graeco-latin squar design. subject were test independ and each experiment session last for up to on hour. we adher to the follow procedur: 1. upon arriv, subject were ask to select two known-item and two exploratori task from the six task of each type. 2. subject were given an overview of the studi in written form that wa read aloud to them by the experiment. 3. subject complet a demograph questionnair focus on aspect of search experi. 4. for each of the four interfac condit: a. subject were given an explan of interfac function last around 2 minut. b. subject were instruct to attempt the task on the assign system search the web, and were allot up to 10 minut to do so. c. upon complet of the task, subject were ask to complet a post-search questionnair. 5. after complet the task on the four system, subject answer a final questionnair compar their experi on the system. 6. subject were thank and compens. in the next section we

posit respons across all system for each differenti-task pair is shown in bold. we appli two-wai analysi of varianc (anova) to each differenti across all four system and two task type. subject found the search easier on querysuggest and querydestin than the other system for known-item task.4 for exploratori task, onli search conduct on querydestin were easier than on the other system.5 subject indic that exploratori task on the three non-baselin system were more stress (i.e., less relax) than the  knownitem task.6 as we will discuss in more detail in section 4.1.3, subject regard the familiar of baselin as a strength, and mai have struggl to attempt a more complex task while learn a new interfac featur such as queri or destin suggest. 4.1.2 interfac support we solicit subject" opinion on the search support offer by querysuggest, querydestin, and sessiondestin. the follow likert scale and semant differenti were us: • likert scale a: us thi system enhanc my effect in find relev inform. (effect)7 • likert scale b: the queri/destin suggest help me get closer to my inform goal. (closetogo) • likert scale c: i would re-us the queri/destin suggest if i encount a similar task in the futur (re-us) • semant differenti a: the queri/destin suggest by the system were: relev/irrelev, us/useless, appropri/inappropri. we did not includ these in the post-search questionnair when subject us the baselin system as thei refer to interfac support option that baselin did not offer. tabl 2 present the averag respons for each of these scale and differenti, us the label after each of the first three likert scale in the bullet list abov. the valu for the three semant differenti ar includ at the bottom of the tabl, as is their overal averag under all. tabl 2. percept of system support (lower = better). scale / differenti known-item exploratori qs qd sd qs qd sd effect 2.7 2.5 2.6 2.8 2.3 2.8 closetogo 2.9 2.7 2.8 2.7 2.2 3.1 re-us 2.9 3 2.4 2.5 2.5 3.2 1 relev 2.6 2.5 2.8 2.4 2 3.1 2 us 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.7 2.1 3.1 3 appropri 2.6 2.4 2.5 2.4 2.4 2.6 all {1,2,3} 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.3 2.9 the result show that all three experiment system improv subject" percept of their search effect over baselin, although onli querydestin did so significantli.8 further examin of the effect size (measur us cohen"s d) reveal that querydestin affect search effect most posit.9 querydestin also appear to get subject closer to their inform goal (closetogo) than querysuggest or 4 easi: f(3,136) = 4.71, p = .0037;

irrelev, not my style (s21), and the relat need to includ explan about why the suggest were offer (e.g., low-qualiti result, not enough inform present (s35)). these comment demonstr a divers rang of perspect on differ aspect of the experiment system. work is obvious need in improv the qualiti of the suggest in all system, but subject seem to distinguish the set when each of these system mai be us. even though all system can at time offer irrelev suggest, subject appear to prefer have them rather than not (e.g., on subject remark suggest were help in some case and harmless in all (s15)). 4.1.4 summari the find obtain from our studi on subject" percept of the four system indic that subject tend to prefer querydestin for the exploratori task and querysuggest for the known-item search. suggest to increment refin the current queri mai be prefer by searcher on known-item task when thei mai have just miss their inform target. howev, when the task is more demand, searcher appreci suggest that have the potenti to dramat influenc the direct of a search or greatli improv topic coverag. 4.2 search task to gain a better understand of how subject perform dure the studi, we analyz data captur on their percept of task complet and the time that it took them to complet each task. 4.2.1 subject percept in the post-search questionnair, subject were ask to indic on a 5-point likert scale the extent to which thei agre with the follow attitud statement: i believ i have succeed in my perform of thi task (success). in addit, thei were ask to complet three 5-point semant differenti indic their respons to the attitud statement: the task we ask you to perform wa: the pair stimuli offer as possibl respons were clear/unclear, simpl/complex, and familiar/ unfamiliar. tabl 4 present the mean averag respons to these statement for each system and task type. 14 although the destin system provid support for search within a domain, subject mainli chose to ignor thi. tabl 4. percept of task and task success (lower = better). scale known-item exploratori b qs qd sd b qs qd sd success 2.0 1.3 1.4 1.4 2.8 2.3 1.4 2.6 1 clear 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.6 2 simpl 1.9 1.4 1.8 1.8 2.4 2.9 2.4 3 3 familiar 2.2 1.9 2.0 2.2 2.6 2.5 2.7 2.7 all {1,2,3} 1.8 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.3 subject respons demonstr that user felt that their search had been more success us querydestin for exploratori task than with the other three system (i.e., there wa a two-wai interact between these two variabl).15 in addit, subject perceiv a significantli greater sens of complet with  knownitem task than with exploratori task.16 subject also found known-item task to be more simpl, clear, and familiar. 17 these respons confirm differ in the natur of the task we had envisag when plan the studi. as illustr by the exampl in figur 3, the known-item task requir subject to retriev a finit set of answer (e.g., find three interest thing to do dure a weekend visit to kyoto, japan). in contrast, the exploratori task were multi-facet, and requir subject to find out more about a topic or to find suffici inform to make a decis. the end-point in such task wa less well-defin and mai have affect subject" percept of when thei had complet the task. given that there wa no differ in the task attempt on each system, theoret the percept of the task" simplic, clariti, and familiar should have been the same for all system. howev, we observ a clear interact effect between the system and subject" percept of the actual task. 4.2.2 task complet time in addit to ask subject to indic the extent to which thei felt the task wa complet, we also monitor the time that it took them to indic to the experiment that thei had finish. the elaps time from when the subject began issu their first queri until when thei indic that thei were done wa monitor us a stopwatch and record for later analysi. a stopwatch rather than system log wa us for thi sinc we want to record the time regardless of system interact. figur 4 show the averag task complet time for each system and each task type. figur 4. mean averag task complet time (± sem). 15 f(3,136) = 6.34, p = .001 16 f(1,136) = 18.95, p < .001 17 f(1,136) = 6.82, p = .028;
