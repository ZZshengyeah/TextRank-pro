worst-case optim redistribut of vcg payment mingyu guo duke univers depart of comput scienc durham, nc, usa mingyu@cs.duke.edu vincent conitz duke univers depart of comput scienc durham, nc, usa conitz@cs.duke.edu abstract for alloc problem with on or more item, the  wellknown vickrei-clark-grove (vcg) mechan is effici, strategi-proof, individu ration, and doe not incur a deficit. howev, the vcg mechan is not (strongli) budget balanc: gener, the agent" payment will sum to more than 0. if there is an auction who is sell the item, thi mai be desir, becaus the surplu  payment correspond to revenu for the auction. howev, if the item do not have an owner and the agent ar mere interest in alloc the item effici among  themselv, ani surplu payment is undesir, becaus it will have to flow out of the system of agent. in 2006,  cavallo [3] propos a mechan that redistribut some of the vcg payment back to the agent, while maintain effici, strategi-proof, individu ration, and the non-deficit properti. in thi paper, we extend thi result in a restrict set. we studi alloc set where there ar multipl indistinguish unit of a singl good, and agent have unit demand. (for thi specif set,  cavallo"s mechan coincid with a mechan propos by bailei in 1997 [2].) here we propos a famili of mechan that redistribut some of the vcg payment back to the agent. all mechan in the famili ar effici,  strategyproof, individu ration, and never incur a deficit. the famili includ the bailei-cavallo mechan as a special case. we then provid an optim model for find the optim mechan-that is, the mechan that maxim redistribut in the worst case-insid the famili, and show how to cast thi model as a linear program. we give both numer and analyt solut of thi linear program, and the (uniqu) result mechan show signific  improv over the bailei-cavallo mechan (in the worst case). final, we prove that the obtain mechan is  optim among all anonym determinist mechan that satisfi the abov properti. categori and subject descriptor j.4 [comput applic]: social and behavior  scienc-econom; i.2.11 [distribut artifici  intellig]: multiag system gener term algorithm, econom, theori 1. introduct mani import problem in comput scienc and  electron commerc can be model as resourc alloc  problem. in such problem, we want to alloc the resourc (or item) to the agent that valu them the most.  unfortun, agent" valuat ar privat knowledg, and self-interest agent will lie about their valuat if thi is to their benefit. on solut is to auction off the item, possibl in a combinatori auction where agent can bid on bundl of item. there exist wai of determin the payment that the agent make in such an auction that  incentiv the agent to report their true valuat-that is, the payment make the auction strategi-proof. on veri gener wai of do so is to us the vcg mechan [23, 4, 12]. (the vcg mechan is also known as the clark mechan or, in the specif context of auction, the  gener vickrei auction.) besid strategi-proof, the vcg mechan ha  sever other nice properti in the context of resourc  alloc problem. it is effici: the chosen alloc alwai maxim the sum of the agent" valuat. it is also  (expost) individu ration: particip in the mechan never make an agent wors off than not particip.  final, it ha a no-deficit properti: the sum of the agent" payment is alwai nonneg. in mani set, anoth properti that would be  desir is (strong) budget balanc, mean that the payment sum to exactli 0. suppos the agent ar try to  distribut some resourc among themselv that do not have a previou owner. for exampl, the agent mai be try to alloc the right to us a share good on a given dai. or, the agent mai be try to alloc a resourc that thei have collect construct, discov, or otherwis obtain. if the agent us an auction to alloc these  resourc, and the sum of the agent" payment in the auction is posit, then thi surplu payment must leav the system 30 of the agent (for exampl, the agent must give the monei to an outsid parti, or burn it). na¨ıve redistribut of the surplu payment (e.g. each of the n agent receiv 1/n of the surplu) will gener result in a mechan that is not strategi-proof (e.g. in a vickrei auction, the second-highest bidder would want to increas her bid to obtain a larger  redistribut payment). unfortun, the vcg mechan is not budget balanc: typic, there is surplu payment. unfortun, in gener set, it is in fact imposs to design mechan that satisfi budget balanc in addit to the other desir properti [16, 11, 21]. in light of thi imposs result, sever author have obtain budget balanc by sacrif some of the other desir properti [2, 6, 22, 5]. anoth approach that is perhap prefer is to us a mechan that is more budget balanc than the vcg mechan, and maintain all the other desir properti. on wai of try to  design such a mechan is to redistribut some of the vcg payment back to the agent in a wai that will not affect the agent" incent (so that strategi-proof is maintain), and that will maintain the other properti. in 2006,  cavallo [3] pursu exactli thi idea, and design a mechan that redistribut a larg amount of the total vcg payment while maintain all of the other desir properti of the vcg mechan. for exampl, in a singl-item auction (where the vcg mechan coincid with the second-price seal-bid auction), the amount redistribut to bidder i by cavallo"s mechan is 1/n time the second-highest bid among bid other than i"s bid. the total redistribut is at most the second-highest bid overal, and the redistribut to agent i doe not affect i"s incent becaus it doe not depend on i"s own bid. in thi paper, we restrict our attent to a limit  set, and in thi set we extend cavallo"s result. we studi alloc set where there ar multipl  indistinguish unit of a singl good, and all agent have unit demand, i.e. thei want onli a singl unit. for thi specif set, cavallo"s mechan coincid with a mechan propos by bailei in 1997 [2]. here we propos the famili of linear vcg redistribut mechan. all mechan in thi famili ar effici, strategi-proof, individu  ration, and never incur a deficit. the famili includ the bailei-cavallo mechan as a special case (with the caveat that we onli studi alloc set with multipl  indistinguish unit of a singl good and unit demand, while bailei"s and cavallo"s mechan can be appli outsid these set as well). we then provid an optim model for find the optim mechan insid the famili, base on worst-case analysi. both numer and  analyt solut of thi model ar provid, and the result mechan show signific improv over the  baileycavallo mechan (in the worst case). for exampl, for the problem of alloc a singl unit, when the number of agent is 10, our mechan alwai redistribut more than 98% of the total vcg payment back to the agent (wherea the bailei-cavallo mechan redistribut onli 80% in the worst case). final, we prove that our  mechan is in fact optim among all anonym determinist mechan (even nonlinear on) that satisfi the desir properti. around the same time, the same mechan ha been  independ deriv by moulin [19].1 moulin actual  pursu a differ object (also base on worst-case analysi): wherea our object is to maxim the percentag of vcg payment that ar redistribut, moulin tri to minim the overal payment from agent as a percentag of  effici. it turn out that the result mechan ar the same. toward the end of thi paper, we consid drop the individu ration requir, and show that thi doe not chang the optim mechan for our object. for moulin"s object, drop individu ration doe chang the optim mechan (but onli if there ar  multipl unit). 2. problem descript let n denot the number of agent, and let m denot the number of unit. we onli consid the case where m < n (otherwis the problem becom trivial). we also assum that m and n ar alwai known. (thi assumpt is not harm: in environ where anyon can join the auction, run a redistribut mechan is typic not a good idea anywai, becaus everyon would want to join to collect part of the redistribut.) let the set of agent be {a1, a2, . . . , an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report valu ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. let vi denot the true valu of ai. given that the mechan is strategi-proof, we can assum vi = ˆvi. under the vcg mechan, each agent among a1, . . . , am win a unit, and pai ˆvm+1 for thi unit. thu, the total vcg payment equal mˆvm+1. when m = 1, thi is the second-price or vickrei auction. we modifi the mechan as follow. after run the origin vcg mechan, the center return to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribut payment. we do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; becaus of thi, ai"s  incent ar unaffect by thi redistribut payment, and the mechan remain strategi-proof. 3. linear vcg redistribut mechan we ar now readi to introduc the famili of linear vcg redistribut mechan. such a mechan is defin by a vector of constant c0, c1, . . . , cn−1. the amount that the mechan return to agent ai is zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. that is, an agent receiv c0, plu c1 time the highest bid other than the agent"s own bid, plu c2 time the second-highest other bid, etc. the mechan is strategi-proof, becaus for all i, zi is independ of ˆvi. also, the mechan is anonym. it is help to see the entir list of redistribut  payment: z1 = c0 + c1ˆv2 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z3 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z4 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn . . . zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn . . . zn−2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn zn−1 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn−1 1 we thank rakesh vohra for point us to moulin"s  work paper. 31 not all choic of the constant c0, . . . , cn−1 produc a mechan that is individu ration, and not all choic of the constant produc a mechan that never incur a deficit. henc, to obtain these properti, we need to place some constraint on the constant. to satisfi the individu ration criterion, each agent"s util should alwai be non-neg. an agent that doe not win a unit obtain a util that is equal to the agent"s redistribut payment. an agent that win a unit obtain a util that is equal to the agent"s valuat for the unit,  minu the vcg payment ˆvm+1, plu the agent"s redistribut payment. consid agent an, the agent with the lowest bid. sinc thi agent doe not win an item (m < n), her util is just her redistribut payment zn. henc, for the mechan to be individu ration, the ci must be such that zn is alwai nonneg. if the ci have thi properti, then it actual follow that zi is nonneg for everi i, for the follow reason. suppos there exist some i < n and some vector of bid ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 such that zi < 0. then, consid the bid vector that result from replac ˆvj by ˆvj+1 for all j ≥ i, and let ˆvn = 0. if we omit ˆvn from thi vector, the same vector result that result from omit ˆvi from the origin vector. therefor, an"s  redistribut payment under the new vector should be the same as ai"s redistribut payment under the old vector-but thi payment is neg. if all redistribut payment ar alwai nonneg, then the mechan must be individu ration (becaus the vcg mechan is individu ration, and the  redistribut payment onli increas an agent"s util). therefor, the mechan is individu ration if and onli if for ani bid vector, zn ≥ 0. to satisfi the non-deficit criterion, the sum of the  redistribut payment should be less than or equal to the total vcg payment. so for ani bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0, the constant ci should make z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1. we defin the famili of linear vcg redistribut  mechan to be the set of all redistribut mechan  correspond to constant ci that satisfi the abov constraint (so that the mechan will be individu ration and have the no-deficit properti). we now give two exampl of mechan in thi famili. exampl 1 (bailei-cavallo mechan): consid the mechan correspond to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i. under thi mechan, each agent receiv a  redistribut payment of m n time the (m+1)th highest bid from anoth agent. henc, a1, . . . , am+1 receiv a redistribut payment of m n ˆvm+2, and the other receiv m n ˆvm+1. thu, the total redistribut payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m− 1)m n ˆvm+1. thi redistribut mechan is individu  ration, becaus all the redistribut payment ar  nonneg, and never incur a deficit, becaus (m + 1) m n ˆvm+2 + (n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1 ≤ nm n ˆvm+1 = mˆvm+1. (we note that for thi mechan to make sens, we need n ≥ m + 2.) exampl 2: consid the mechan correspond to cm+1 = m n−m−1 , cm+2 = − m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) , and ci = 0 for all other i. in thi mechan, each agent receiv a redistribut payment of m n−m−1 time the (m + 1)th  highest report valu from other agent, minu m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) time the (m+2)th highest report valu from other agent. thu, the total redistribut payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3. if n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equival to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent alwai receiv a nonneg redistribut payment, thu the mechan is individu ration. also, the mechan never incur a deficit, becaus the total vcg payment is mˆvm+1, which is greater than the amount mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3 that is redistribut. which of these two mechan is better? is there anoth mechan that is even better? thi is what we studi in the next section. 4. optim redistribut mechan among all linear vcg redistribut mechan, we would like to be abl to identifi the on that redistribut the greatest percentag of the total vcg payment.2 thi is not a well-defin notion: it mai be that on mechan  redistribut more on some bid vector, and anoth more on other bid vector. we emphas that we do not assum that a prior distribut over bidder" valuat is avail, so we cannot compar them base on expect redistribut. below, we studi three well-defin wai of compar  redistribut mechan: best-case perform, domin, and worst-case perform. best-case perform. on wai of evalu a  mechan is by consid the highest redistribut  percentag that it achiev. consid the previou two exampl. for the first exampl, the total redistribut payment is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1. when ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1, thi is equal to the total vcg payment mˆvm+1. thu, thi mechan redistribut 100% of the total vcg payment in the best case. for the second exampl, the total  redistribut payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3. when ˆvm+3 = 0, thi is equal to the total vcg payment mˆvm+1. thu, thi mechan also redistribut 100% of the total vcg payment in the best case. moreov, there ar actual infinit mani mechan that redistribut 100% of the total vcg payment in the best case-for exampl, ani convex combin of the abov two will redistribut 100% if both ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 and ˆvm+3 = 0. domin. insid the famili of linear vcg  redistribut mechan, we sai on mechan domin anoth mechan if the first on redistribut at least as much as the other for ani bid vector. for the previou two exampl, neither domin the other, becaus thei each redistribut 100% in differ case. it turn out that there is no  mechan in the famili that domin all other mechan in the famili. for suppos such a mechan exist. then, it should domin both exampl abov. consid the  remain vcg payment (the vcg payment fail to be  redistribut). the remain vcg payment of the domin mechan should be 0 whenev ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 or ˆvm+3 = 0. now, the remain vcg payment is a linear function of the ˆvi (linear redistribut), and therefor also a polynomi function. the abov impli that thi function can be  written as (ˆvm+2 − ˆvm+1)(ˆvm+3)p(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn), where p is a 2 the percentag redistribut seem the natur criterion to us, among other thing becaus it is scale-invari: if we multipli all bid by the same posit constant (for exampl, if we chang the unit by re-express the bid in euro instead of dollar), we would not want the behavior of our mechan to chang. 32 polynomi function. but sinc the function must be linear (ha degre at most 1), it follow that p = 0. thu, a  domin mechan would alwai redistribut all of the vcg payment, which is not possibl. (if it were possibl, then our worst-case optim redistribut mechan would also  alwai redistribut all of the vcg payment, and we will see later that it doe not.) worst-case perform. final, we can evalu a mechan by consid the lowest redistribut  percentag that it guarante. for the first exampl, the total  redistribut payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1, which is greater than or equal to (n−m−1) m n ˆvm+1. so in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+2 = 0, the percentag  redistribut is n−m−1 n . for the second exampl, the total  redistribut payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3, which is greater than or equal to mˆvm+1(1− (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ). so in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+3 = ˆvm+1, the  percentag redistribut is 1 − (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) . sinc we  assum that the number of agent n and the number of unit m ar known, we can determin which exampl mechan ha better worst-case perform by compar the two quantiti. when n = 6 and m = 1, for the first exampl (bailei-cavallo mechan), the percentag redistribut in the worst case is 2 3 , and for the second exampl, thi  percentag is 1 2 , which impli that for thi pair of n and m, the first mechan ha better worst-case perform. on the other hand, when n = 12 and m = 1, for the first  exampl, the percentag redistribut in the worst case is 5 6 , and for the second exampl, thi percentag is 14 15 , which impli that thi time the second mechan ha better worst-case perform. thu, it seem most natur to compar mechan by the percentag of total vcg payment that thei redistribut in the worst case. thi percentag is undefin when the total vcg payment is 0. to deal with thi, technic, we defin the worst-case redistribut percentag as the largest k so that the total amount redistribut is at least k time the total vcg payment, for all bid vector. (henc, as long as the total amount redistribut is at least 0 when the total vcg payment is 0, these case do not affect the worst-case percentag.) thi correspond to the follow optim problem: maxim k (the percentag redistribut in the worst case) subject to: for everi bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 zn ≥ 0 (individu ration) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 (non-deficit) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≥ kmˆvm+1 (worst-case constraint) we recal that zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. 5. transform to linear program the optim problem given in the previou section can be rewritten as a linear program, base on the follow observ. claim 1. if c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 satisfi both the individu  ration and the non-deficit constraint, then ci = 0 for i = 0, . . . , m. proof. first, let us prove that c0 = 0. consid the bid vector in which ˆvi = 0 for all i. to obtain individu ration, we must have c0 ≥ 0. to satisfi the non-deficit constraint, we must have c0 ≤ 0. thu we know c0 = 0. now, if ci = 0 for all i, there is noth to prove. otherwis, let j = min{i|ci = 0}. assum that j ≤ m. we recal that we can write the individu ration constraint as follow: zn = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +c3ˆv3 +. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2 +cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for ani bid vector. let us consid the bid vector in which ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for the rest. in thi case zn = cj, so we must have cj ≥ 0. the non-deficit constraint can be written as follow: z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 for ani bid vector. consid the same bid vector as abov. we have zi = 0 for i ≤ j, becaus for these bid, the jth highest other bid ha valu 0, so all the ci that ar nonzero ar multipli by 0. for i > j, we have zi = cj, becaus the jth highest other bid ha valu 1, and all lower bid have valu 0. so the non-deficit constraint tell us that cj(n − j) ≤ mˆvm+1. becaus j ≤ m, ˆvm+1 = 0, so the right hand side is 0. we also have n − j > 0 becaus j ≤ m < n. so cj ≤ 0. becaus we have alreadi establish that cj ≥ 0, it follow that cj = 0; but thi is contrari to assumpt. so j > m. incident, thi claim also show that if m = n − 1, then ci = 0 for all i. thu, we ar stuck with the vcg mechan. from here on, we onli consid the case where m < n − 1. claim 2. the individu ration constraint can be  written as follow: pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. befor prove thi claim, we introduc the follow lemma. lemma 1. given a posit integ k and a set of real constant s1, s2, . . . , sk, (s1t1 + s2t2 + . . . + sktk ≥ 0 for ani t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tk ≥ 0) if and onli if ( pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k). proof. let di = ti −ti+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k−1, and dk = tk. then (s1t1 +s2t2 +. . .+sktk ≥ 0 for ani t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tk ≥ 0) is equival to (( p1 i=1 si)d1 + ( p2 i=1 si)d2 + . . . + ( pk i=1 si)dk ≥ 0 for ani set of arbitrari non-neg dj). when pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, the abov inequ is obvious true. if for some j, pj i=1 si < 0, if we set dj > 0 and di = 0 for all i = j, then the abov inequ becom fals. so pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k is both necessari and suffici. we ar now readi to present the proof of claim 2. proof. the individu ration constraint can be  written as zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for ani bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn−1 ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. we have alreadi shown that ci = 0 for i ≤ m. thu, the abov can be simplifi to zn = cm+1ˆvm+1 + cm+2ˆvm+2+. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2+cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for ani bid vector. by the abov lemma, thi is equival to pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. claim 3. the non-deficit constraint and the worst-case constraint can also be written as linear inequ involv onli the ci and k. proof. the non-deficit constraint requir that for ani bid vector, z1 +z2 +. . .+zn ≤ mˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 + 33 c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 +ciˆvi+1 +. . .+cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. becaus ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplifi thi inequ to qm+1ˆvm+1 + qm+2ˆvm+2 + . . . + qnˆvn ≥ 0 qm+1 = m − (n − m − 1)cm+1 qi = −(i−1)ci−1 −(n−i)ci, for i = m+2, . . . , n−1 (when m + 2 > n − 1, thi set of equal is empti) qn = −(n − 1)cn−1 by the abov lemma, thi is equival to pj i=m+1 qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n. so, we can simplifi further as follow: qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m qm+1 + . . . + qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 qm+1 + . . . + qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m so, the non-deficit constraint can be written as a set of linear inequ involv onli the ci. the worst-case constraint can be also written as a set of linear inequ, by the follow reason. the  worstcas constraint requir that for ani bid input z1 +z2 +. . .+ zn ≥ kmˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. becaus ci = 0 for

thi is equival to pj i=m+1 qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n. so, we can simplifi further as follow: qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≥ km qm+1 + . . . + qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≥ km for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 qm+1 + . . . + qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≥ km so, the worst-case constraint can also be written as a set of linear inequ involv onli the ci and k. combin all the claim, we see that the origin  optim problem can be transform into the follow linear program. variabl: cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn−1, k maxim k (the percentag redistribut in the worst case) subject to:pj

doe better in the worst case than the  baileycavallo mechan doe on averag, as the follow  exampl show. recal that the total redistribut payment of the  baileycavallo mechan is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1. for the singl-unit case, thi simplifi to 2 n ˆv3 + n−2 n ˆv2. henc the percentag of the total vcg payment that is not redistribut is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which ha an expect valu of e( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n e ˆv3 ˆv2 .  suppos the bid valu ar drawn from a uniform distribut over [0, 1]. the theori of order statist tell us that the 34 joint probabl densiti function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3. now, e ˆv3 ˆv2 = r 1 0 r ˆv2 0 ˆv3 ˆv2 f(ˆv3, ˆv2)dˆv3dˆv2 = n−2 n−1 . so, the expect valu of the remain percentag is 2 n − 2 n n−2 n−1 = 2 n(n−1) . for n = 20, thi is 5.26e − 3, wherea the remain percentag for the worst-case optim mechan is 3.62e−5 in the worst case. let us present the optim solut for the case n = 5 in detail. by solv the abov linear program, we find that the optim valu for the ci ar c2 = 11 45 , c3 = −1 9 , and c4 = 1 15 . that is, the redistribut payment receiv by each agent is: 11 45 time the second highest bid among the other agent, minu 1 9 time the third highest bid among the other agent, plu 1 15 time the fourth highest bid among the other agent. the total amount redistribut is 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 − 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5; in the worst case, 11 15 ˆv2 is redistribut. henc, the percentag of the total vcg payment that is not  redistribut is never more than 4 15 = 26.7%. final, we compar the worst-case optim mechan to the bailei-cavallo mechan for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, n = m + 2, . . . , 30. these result ar in figur 1. we see that for ani m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optim mechan ha the same worst-case perform as the bailei-cavallo mechan (actual, in thi case, the worst-case optim mechan is ident to the  baileycavallo mechan). when n > m + 2, the worst-case  optim mechan outperform the bailei-cavallo mechan (in the worst case). 7. analyt character of the worst-case optim mechan we recal that our linear program ha the follow form: variabl: cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn−1, k maxim k (the percentag redistribut in the worst case) subject to:pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1 km ≤ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ n pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m a linear program ha no solut if and onli if either the object is unbound, or the constraint ar contradictori (there is no feasibl solut). it is easi to see that k is bound abov by 1 (redistribut more than 100%  violat the non-deficit constraint). also, a feasibl solut alwai exist, for exampl, k = 0 and ci = 0 for all i. so an optim solut alwai exist. observ that the linear  program model depend onli on the number of agent n and the number of unit m. henc the optim solut is a function of n and m. it turn out that thi optim solut can be analyt character as follow. theorem 1. for ani m and n with n ≥ m+2, the  worstcas optim mechan (among linear vcg redistribut mechan) is uniqu. for thi mechan, the percentag redistribut in the worst case is k∗ = 1 − `n−1 m ´ pn−1 j=m `n−1 j ´ the worst-case optim mechan is character by the follow valu for the ci: c∗ i = (−1)i+m−1 (n − m) `n−1 m−1 ´ i pn−1 j=m `n−1 j ´ 1 `n−1 i ´ n−1x j=i n − 1 j ! for i = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. it should be note that we have prove ci = 0 for i ≤ m in claim 1. proof. we first rewrit the linear program as follow. we introduc new variabl xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xn−1, defin by xj = pj i=m+1 ci for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. the linear program then becom: variabl: xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xn−1, k maxim k subject to: km ≤ (n − m − 1)xm+1 ≤ m km ≤ (m + i)xm+i−1 + (n − m − i)xm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ nxn−1 ≤ m xi ≥ 0 for i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 we will prove that for ani optim solut to thi linear program, k = k∗ . moreov, we will prove that when k = k∗ , xj = pj i=m+1 c∗ i for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. thi will prove the theorem. we first make the follow observ: (n − m − 1)c∗ m+1 = (n − m − 1) (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (m+1) pn−1 j=m

(n−1 n−1) pn−1 j=n−1 `n−1 j ´ = (−1)m+n m(1 − k∗ ) summar the abov, we have: (n − m − 1)c∗ m+1 = k∗ m (m + 1)c∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)c∗ m+2 = m(1 − k∗ ) (m + 2)c∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)c∗ m+3 = −m(1 − k∗ ) (m

c∗ i for j = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1, the first equat in the abov tell us that (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1 = k∗ m. by ad the first two equat, we get (m + 2)x∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2 = m by ad the first three equat, we get (m + 3)x∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3 = k∗ m by ad the first i equat, where i = 2, . . . , n−m−1, we get (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = m if i is even (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = k∗ m if i is odd final by ad all the equat, we get nx∗ n−1 = m if n − m is even; nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m if n − m is odd. thu, for all of the constraint other than the  nonneg constraint, we have shown that thei ar satisfi by set xj = x∗ j = pj i=m+1 c∗ i and k = k∗ . we next show that the nonneg constraint ar satisfi by these  set as well. for m + 1 ≤ i, i + 1 ≤ n − 1, we have 1 i pn−1 j=i (n−1 j ) (n−1 i ) = 1 i pn−1 j=i i!(n−1−i)! j!(n−1−j)! ≥ 1 i+1 pn−2 j=i i!(n−1−i)! j!(n−1−j)! ≥ 1 i+1 pn−2 j=i (i+1)!(n−1−i−1)! (j+1)!(n−1−j−1)! = 1 i+1 pn−1 j=i+1 (n−1 j ) (n−1 i+1 ) thi impli that the absolut valu of c∗ i is decreas as i increas (if the c∗ contain more than on number). we further observ that the sign of c∗ i altern, with the first element c∗ m+1 posit. so x∗ j = pj i=m+1 c∗ i ≥ 0 for all j. thu, we have shown that these xi = x∗ i togeth with k = k∗ form a feasibl solut of the linear program. we proce to show that it is in fact the uniqu optim solut. first we prove the follow claim: claim 4. if ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 satisfi the follow inequ: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)ˆxm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)ˆxm+i−1 + (n − m − i)ˆxm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 ˆkm ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ m ˆk ≥ k∗ then we must have that ˆxi = ˆx∗ i and ˆk = k∗ . proof of claim. consid the first inequ. we know that (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1 = k∗ m, so (n − m − 1)ˆxm+1 ≥ ˆkm ≥ k∗ m = (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1. it follow that ˆxm+1 ≥ x∗ m+1 (n − m − 1 = 0). now, consid the next inequ for i = 2. we know that (m + 2)x∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2 = m. it follow that (n−m−2)ˆxm+2 ≤ m−(m+2)ˆxm+1 ≤ m−(m+2)x∗ m+1 = (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2, so ˆxm+2 ≤ x∗ m+2 (i = 2 ≤ n − m − 1 ⇒ n − m − 2 = 0). now consid the next inequ for i = 3. we know that (m + 3)x∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3 = m. it follow that (n−m−3)ˆxm+3 ≥ ˆkm−(m+3)ˆxm+2 ≥ k∗ m−(m+3)x∗ m+2 = (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3, so ˆxm+3 ≥ x∗ m+3 (i = 3 ≤ n − m − 1 ⇒ n − m − 3 = 0). proceed like thi all the wai up to i = n−m−1, we get that ˆxm+i ≥ x∗ m+i if i is odd and ˆxm+i ≤ x∗ m+i if i is even. moreov, if on inequ is strict, then all subsequ  inequ ar strict. now, if we can prove ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1, it would follow that the x∗ i ar equal to the ˆxi (which also impli that ˆk = k∗ ). we consid two case: case 1: n − m is even. we have: n − m even ⇒ n − m − 1 odd ⇒ ˆxn−1 ≥ x∗ n−1. we also have: n−m even ⇒ nx∗ n−1 = m. combin these two, we get m = nx∗ n−1 ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ m ⇒ ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1. case 2: n − m is odd. in thi case, we have ˆxn−1 ≤ x∗ n−1, and nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m. then, we have: k∗ m ≤ ˆkm ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m ⇒ ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1. thi complet the proof of the claim. it follow that if ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 is a feasibl solut and ˆk ≥ k∗ , then sinc all the inequ in claim 4 ar satisfi, we must have ˆxi = x∗ i and ˆk = k∗ . henc no other feasibl solut is as good as the on describ in the theorem. know the analyt character of the worst-case optim mechan provid us with at least two major  benefit. first, us these formula is computation more effici than solv the linear program us a  generalpurpos solver. second, we can deriv the follow  corollari. corollari 1. if the number of unit m is fix, then as the number of agent n increas, the worst-case percentag redistribut linearli converg to 1, with a rate of  converg 1 2 . (that is, limn→∞ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = 1 2 . that is, in the limit, the percentag that is not redistribut halv for  everi addit agent.) we note that thi is consist with the experiment data for the singl-unit case, where the worst-case remain  percentag roughli halv each time we add anoth agent. the worst-case percentag that is redistribut under the bailei-cavallo mechan also converg to 1 as the  number of agent goe to infin, but the converg is much slower-it doe not converg linearli (that is, let kc n be the percentag redistribut by the bailei-cavallo  mechan in the worst case for n agent, limn→∞ 1−kc n+1 1−kc n = limn→∞ n n+1 = 1). we now present the proof of the  corollari. proof. when the number of agent is n, the worst-case percentag redistribut is k∗ n = 1 − (n−1 m ) pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) . when the number of agent is n + 1, the percentag becom k∗ n+1 = 1 − (n m) pn j=m (n j ) . for n suffici larg, we will have 2n − mnm−1 > 0, and henc 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = (n m) pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) (n−1 m ) pn j=m (n j ) = n n−m 2n−1 − pm−1 j=0 (n−1 j ) 2n− pm−1 j=0 (n j ) , and n n−m 2n−1 −m(n−1)m−1 2n ≤ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n ≤ n n−m 2n−1 2n−mnm−1 (becaus `n j ´ ≤ ni if j ≤ i). sinc we have limn→∞ n n−m 2n−1 −m(n−1)m−1 2n = 1 2 , and limn→∞ n n−m 2n−1 2n−mnm−1 = 1 2 , it follow that limn→∞ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = 1 2 . 36 8. worst-case optim outsid the famili in thi section, we prove that the worst-case optim  redistribut mechan among linear vcg redistribut mechan is in fact optim (in the worst case) among all redistribut mechan that ar determinist,  anonym, strategi-proof, effici and satisfi the non-deficit constraint. thu, restrict our attent to linear vcg redistribut mechan did not come at a loss. to prove thi theorem, we need the follow lemma. thi lemma is not new: it wa inform state by cavallo [3]. for complet, we present it here with a detail proof. lemma 2. a vcg redistribut mechan is  determinist, anonym and strategi-proof if and onli if there exist a function f : rn−1 → r, so that the redistribut payment zi receiv by ai satisfi zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vector. proof. first, let us prove the onli if direct, that is, if a vcg redistribut mechan is determinist,  anonym and strategi-proof then there exist a determinist function f : rn−1 → r, which make zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vector. if a vcg redistribut mechan is determinist and anonym, then for ani bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn, the mechan output a uniqu redistribut payment list: z1, z2, . . . , zn. let g : rn → rn be the function that map ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn to z1, z2, . . . , zn for all bid vector. let h(i, x1, x2, . . . , xn) be the ith element of g(x1, x2, . . . , xn), so that zi = h(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) for all bid vector and all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. becaus the mechan is anonym, two agent should receiv the same redistribut payment if their bid ar the same. so, if ˆvi = ˆvj, h(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = h(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn). henc, if we let j = min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, then h(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = h(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn). let us defin k : rn → n × rn as follow: k(y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = [j, w1, w2, . . . , wn], where w1, w2, . . . , wn ar y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 sort in descend order, and j = min{t|wt = y}. ({t|wt = y} = ∅ becaus y ∈ {w1, w2, . . . , wn}). also let us defin f : rn → r by f(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) = h ◦ k(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) = h(min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = h(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = zi. that is, f is the redistribut payment to an agent that bid ˆvi when the other bid ar ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn. sinc our mechan is requir to be strategi-proof, and the space of valuat is unrestrict, zi should be  independ of ˆvi by lemma 1 in cavallo [3]. henc, we can simpli ignor the first variabl input to f; let f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = f(0, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1). so, we have for all bid vector and i, zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn). thi complet the proof for the onli if direct. for the if direct, if the redistribut payment  receiv by ai satisfi zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all bid vector and i, then thi is clearli a determinist and anonym mechan. to prove strategi-proof, we  observ that becaus an agent"s redistribut payment is not affect by her own bid, her incent ar the same as in the vcg mechan, which is strategi-proof. now we ar readi to introduc the next theorem: theorem 2. for ani m and n with n ≥ m+2, the  worstcas optim mechan among the famili of linear vcg redistribut mechan is worst-case optim among all mechan that ar determinist, anonym, strategi-proof, effici and satisfi the non-deficit constraint. while we need individu ration earlier in the  paper, thi theorem doe not mention it, that is, we can not find a mechan with better worst-case perform even if we sacrific individu ration. (the worst-case optim linear vcg redistribut mechan is of cours  individu ration.) proof. suppos there is a redistribut mechan (when the number of unit is m and the number of agent is n) that satisfi all of the abov properti and ha a better  worstcas perform than the worst-case optim linear vcg redistribut mechan, that is, it worst-case  redistribut percentag ˆk is strictli greater than k∗ . by lemma 2, for thi mechan, there is a function f : rn−1 → r so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vector. we first prove that f ha the follow properti. claim 5. f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. proof of claim. we assum that for thi mechan, the worst-case redistribut percentag satisfi ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0. if the total vcg payment is x, the total redistribut payment should be in [ˆkx, x] (non-deficit criterion).  consid the case where all agent bid 0, so that the total vcg payment is also 0. henc, the total redistribut payment should be in [ˆk · 0, 0]-that is, it should be 0. henc everi agent"s redistribut payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0) must be 0. now, let ti = f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) where the number of 1s equal i. we prove t0 = 0. if tn−1 = 0, consid the bid vector where everyon bid 1. the total vcg payment is m and the total redistribut payment is nf(1, 1, . . . , 1) = ntn−1 = 0. thi correspond to 0% redistribut, which is contrari to our assumpt that ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0. now, consid j = min{i|ti = 0} (which is well-defin becaus tn−1 = 0). if j > m, the properti is satisfi. if j ≤ m, consid the bid vector where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. under thi bid vector, the first j agent each get redistribut payment tj−1 = 0, and the remain n − j agent each get tj. thu, the total redistribut payment is (n − j)tj. becaus the total vcg payment for thi bid vector is 0, we must have (n − j)tj = 0. so tj = 0 (j ≤ m < n). but thi is contrari to the definit of j. henc f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. claim 6. f satisfi the follow inequ: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)tm+i−1 + (n − m − i)tm+i ≤ m for i = 2, 3, . . . , n − m − 1 ˆkm ≤ ntn−1 ≤ m here ti is defin as in the proof of claim 5. 37 proof of claim. for j = m + 1, . . . , n, consid the bid vector where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. these bid vector togeth with the non-deficit constraint and worst-case constraint produc the abov set of  inequ: for exampl, when j = m + 1, we consid the bid vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. the first m+1 agent each receiv a redistribut payment of tm = 0, and all other agent each receiv tm+1. thu, the total vcg redistribut is (n − m − 1)tm+1. the  nondeficit constraint give (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m (becaus the total vcg payment is m). the worst-case constraint give (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≥ ˆkm. combin these two, we get the first inequ. the other inequ can be obtain in the same wai. we now observ that the inequ in claim 6, togeth with ˆk ≥ k∗ , ar the same as those in claim 4 (where the ti ar replac by the ˆxi). thu, we can conclud that ˆk = k∗ , which is contrari to our assumpt ˆk > k∗ . henc no  mechan satisfi all the list properti ha a redistribut percentag greater than k∗ in the worst case. so far we have onli talk about the case where n ≥ m+2. for the purpos of complet, we provid the follow claim for the n = m + 1 case. claim 7. for ani m and n with n = m + 1, the origin vcg mechan (that is, redistribut noth) is (uniqu) worst-case optim among all redistribut mechan that ar determinist, anonym, strategi-proof, effici and satisfi the non-deficit constraint. we recal that when n = m+1, claim 1 tell us that the onli mechan insid the famili of linear redistribut  mechan is the origin vcg mechan, so that thi  mechan is automat worst-case optim insid thi famili. howev, to prove the abov claim, we need to show that it is worst-case optim among all redistribut mechan that have the desir properti. proof. suppos a redistribut mechan exist that satisfi all of the abov properti and ha a worst-case perform as good as the origin vcg mechan, that is, it worst-case redistribut percentag is greater than or equal to 0. thi impli that the total redistribut payment of thi mechan is alwai nonneg. by lemma 2, for thi mechan, there is a function f : rn−1 → r so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vector. we will prove that f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0. first, consid the bid vector where ˆvi = 0 for all i. here, each agent receiv a redistribut payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0). the total redistribut payment is then nf(0, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0 (by the abov observ) as well less than or equal to 0 (us the  nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total vcg payment is 0). it follow that f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0. now, let us consid the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. for thi bid vector, the agent with the highest bid receiv a redistribut payment of f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, and the other n − 1 agent each receiv f(x1, 0, . . . , 0). by the same  reason as abov, the total redistribut payment should be both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0, henc f(x1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ 0. proceed by induct, let us assum f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ 0, for some k < n − 1. consid the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi ar  arbitrari number satisfi x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. for the agent with the highest k + 1 bid, their  redistribut payment is specifi by f act on an input with onli k non-zero variabl. henc thei all receiv 0 by  induct assumpt. the other n − k − 1 agent each  receiv f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0). the total  redistribut payment is then (n−k−1)f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to the total vcg payment. now, in thi bid vector, the lowest bid is 0 becaus k + 1 < n. but sinc n = m + 1, the total vcg payment is mˆvn = 0. so we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. by induct, thi  statement hold for all k < n − 1; when k + 1 = n − 1, we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−2, xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−2 ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0. henc, in thi mechan, the  redistribut payment is alwai 0; that is, the mechan is just the origin vcg mechan. incident, we obtain the follow corollari: corollari 2. no vcg redistribut mechan  satisfi all of the follow: determin, anonym,  strategyproof, effici, and (strong) budget balanc. thi hold for ani n ≥ m + 1. proof. for the case n ≥ m + 2: if such a mechan exist, it worst-case perform would be better than that of the worst-case optim linear vcg redistribut  mechan, which by theorem 1 obtain a redistribut  percentag strictli less than 1. but theorem 2 show that it is imposs to outperform thi mechan in the worst case. for the case n = m + 1: if such a mechan exist, it would perform as well as the origin vcg mechan in the worst case, which impli that it is ident to the vcg mechan by claim 7. but the vcg mechan is not (strongli) budget balanc. 9. conclus for alloc problem with on or more item, the  wellknown vickrei-clark-grove (vcg) mechan is effici, strategi-proof, individu ration, and doe not incur a deficit. howev, the vcg mechan is not (strongli) budget balanc: gener, the agent" payment will sum to more than 0. if there is an auction who is sell the item, thi mai be desir, becaus the surplu  payment correspond to revenu for the auction. howev, if the item do not have an owner and the agent ar mere interest in alloc the item effici among  themselv, ani surplu payment is undesir, becaus it will have to flow out of the system of agent. in 2006,  cavallo [3] propos a mechan that redistribut some of the vcg payment back to the agent, while maintain  effici, strategi-proof, individu ration, and the non-deficit properti. in thi paper, we extend thi  result in a restrict set. we studi alloc set where there ar multipl indistinguish unit of a  singl good, and agent have unit demand. (for thi specif set, cavallo"s mechan coincid with a mechan propos by bailei in 1997 [2].) here we propos a famili of mechan that redistribut some of the vcg payment 38 back to the agent. all mechan in the famili ar  effici, strategi-proof, individu ration, and never incur a deficit. the famili includ the bailei-cavallo mechan as a special case. we then provid an optim model for find the optim mechan-that is, the mechan that maxim redistribut in the worst case-insid the famili, and show how to cast thi model as a linear  program. we gave both numer and analyt solut of thi linear program, and the (uniqu) result  mechan show signific improv over the bailei-cavallo mechan (in the worst case). final, we prove that the obtain mechan is optim among all anonym  determinist mechan that satisfi the abov properti. on import direct for futur research is to try to extend these result beyond multi-unit auction with unit demand. howev, it turn out that in suffici gener set, the worst-case optim redistribut percentag is 0. in such set, the worst-case criterion provid no guidanc in determin a good redistribut mechan (even redistribut noth achiev the optim worst-case percentag), so it becom necessari to pursu other criteria. altern, on can try to identifi other special set in which posit redistribut in the worst case is possibl. anoth direct for futur research is to consid whether thi mechan ha applic to collus. for exampl, in a typic collus scheme, there is a bid ring  consist of a number of collud, who submit onli a singl bid [10, 17]. if thi bid win, the collud must alloc the item amongst themselv, perhap us payment-but of cours thei do not want payment to flow out of the ring. thi work is part of a grow literatur on design mechan that obtain good result in the worst case.  tradition, economist have mostli focus either on  design mechan that alwai obtain certain properti (such as the vcg mechan), or on design mechan that ar optim with respect to some prior distribut over the agent" prefer (such as the myerson auction [20] and the maskin-rilei auction [18] for maxim expect revenu). some more recent paper have focus on design  mechan for profit maxim us worst-case competit analysi (e.g. [9, 1, 15, 8]). there ha also been grow interest in the design of onlin mechan [7] where the agent arriv over time and decis must be taken befor all the agent have arriv. such work often also take a worst-case competit analysi approach [14, 13]. it doe not appear that there ar direct connect between our work and these other work that focu on design  mechan that perform well in the worst case. nevertheless, it seem like that futur research will continu to  investig mechan design for the worst case, and hopefulli a coher framework will emerg. 10. refer [1] g. aggarw, a. fiat, a. goldberg, j. hartlin, n. immorlica, and m. sudan. derandom of auction. stoc, 619-625, 2005.
