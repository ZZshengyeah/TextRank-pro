that is, what kind of logic languag might be us to repres and reason about judgment aggreg? an agent"s knowledg represent languag should be abl to  express: common aggreg rule such as major vote;  commonli discuss properti of judgment aggreg rule and  social welfar function such as independ; paradox commonli us to illustr judgment aggreg and prefer aggreg, viz. the discurs paradox and condorcet"s paradox respect; and other import properti such as arrow"s theorem. in order to illustr in more detail what such a languag would need to be abl to express, take the exampl of a potenti properti of social welfar function (swf) call independ of irrelev  altern (iia): given two prefer profil (each consist of on prefer relat for each agent) and two altern, if for each agent the two altern have the same order in the two prefer profil, then the two altern must have the same order in the two prefer relat result from appli the swf to the two prefer profil, respect. from thi exampl it seem that a formal languag for swf should be abl to express: 566 978-81-904262-7-5 (rp) c 2007 ifaama • quantif on sever level: over altern; over  prefer profil, i.e., over relat over altern  (secondord quantif); and over agent. • properti of prefer relat for differ agent, and properti of sever differ prefer relat for the same agent in the same formula. • comparison of differ prefer relat. • the prefer relat result from appli a swf to other prefer relat. from these point it might seem that such a languag would be rather complex (in particular, these requir seem to rule out a standard proposit modal logic). perhap surprisingli, the  languag of jal is syntact and semant rather simpl; and yet the languag is, nevertheless, express enough to give eleg and succinct express of, e.g., iia, major vote, the discurs dilemma, condorcet"s paradox and arrow"s theorem. thi mean, for exampl, that arrow"s theorem is a formal theorem of jal, i.e., a deriv formula; we thu have a formal proof theori for social choic. the structur of the rest of the paper is as follow. in the next section we review the basic of judgment aggreg as well as prefer aggreg, and mention some commonli discuss properti of judgment aggreg rule and social welfar  function. in section 3 we introduc the syntax and semant of jal, and studi the complex of the model check problem.  formula of jal ar interpret directli by, and thu repres properti of, judgment aggreg rule. in section 4 we demonstr that the logic can express commonli discuss properti of judgment aggreg rule, such as the discurs paradox. we give a sound and complet axiomatis of the logic in section 5, under the  assumpt that the agenda the agent make judgment over is finit. as mention abov, prefer aggreg can be seen as a  special case of judgment aggreg, and in section 6 we introduc an altern interpret of jal formula directli in social welfar function. we obtain a sound and complet axiomatis of the logic for prefer aggreg as well. section 7 and 8 discuss relat work and conclud. 2. judgment and prefer aggreg judgment aggreg is concern with judgment aggreg rule aggreg set of logic formula; prefer aggreg is concern with social welfar function aggreg prefer over some set of altern. let n be a number of agent; we write Σ for the set {1, . . . , n}. 2.1 judgment aggreg rule let l be a logic with languag l(l). we requir that the  languag ha negat and materi implic, with the usual  semant. we will sometim refer to l as the underli logic. an agenda over l is a non-empti set a ⊆ l(l), where for everi  formula φ that doe not start with a negat, φ ∈ a iff ¬φ ∈ a. we sometim call a member of a an agenda item. a subset a ⊆ a is consist unless a entail both ¬φ and φ in l for some φ ∈ l(l); a is complet if either φ ∈ a or ¬φ ∈ a for everi φ ∈ a which doe not start with negat. an (admiss) individu judgment set is a complet and consist subset ai ⊆ a of the agenda. the idea here is that a judgment set ai repres the choic from a made by agent i. two ration criteria demand that an agent" choic at least be intern consist, and that each agent make a decis between everi item and it negat. an (admiss) judgment profil is an n-tupl a1, . . . , an , where ai is the  individu judgment set of agent i. j(a, l) denot the set of all individu (complet and l-consist) judgment set over a, and j(a, l)n the set of all judgment profil over a. when γ ∈ j(a, l)n , we us γi to denot the ith element of γ, i.e., agent i"s individu judgment set in judgment profil γ. a judgment aggreg rule (jar) is a function f that map each judgment profil a1, . . . , an to a complet and consist  collect judgment set f(a1, . . . , an) ∈ j(a, l). such a rule henc is a recip to enforc a ration group decis, given an tupl of  ration choic by the individu agent. of cours, such a rule should to a certain extent be ‘fair". some possibl properti of a judgment aggreg rule f over an agenda a: non-dictatorship (nd1) there is no agent i such that for everi judgment profil a1, . . . , an , f(a1, . . . , an) = ai independ (ind) for ani p ∈ a and judgment profil a1, . . . , an and b1, . . . , bn , if for all agent i (p ∈ ai iff p ∈ bi), then p ∈ f(a1, . . . , an) iff p ∈ f(b1, . . . , bn) unanim (una) for ani judgment profil a1, . . . , an and ani p ∈ a, if p ∈ ai for all agent i, then p ∈ f(a1, . . . , an) 2.2 social welfar function social welfar function (swf) ar usual defin in term of ordin prefer structur, rather than cardin structur such as util function. an swf take a prefer relat, a binari  relat over some set of altern, for each agent, and output  anoth prefer relat repres the aggreg prefer. the most well known result about swf is arrow"s theorem [1]. mani variant of the theorem appear in the literatur, differ in assumpt about the prefer relat. in thi paper, we take the assumpt that all prefer relat ar linear order, i.e., that neither agent nor the aggreg prefer can be indiffer between distinct altern. thi give on of the simplest  formul of arrow"s theorem (theorem 1 below). cf., e.g., [2] for a discuss and more gener formul. formal, let k be a set of altern. we henceforth  implicitli assum that there ar alwai at least two altern. a  prefer relat (over k) is, here, a total (linear) order on k, i.e., a relat r over k which is antisymmetr (i.e., (a, b) ∈ r and (b, a) ∈ r impli that a = b), transit (i.e., (a, b) ∈ r and (b, c) ∈ r impli that (a, c) ∈ r), and total (i.e., either (a, b) ∈ r or (b, a) ∈ r). we sometim us the infix notat arb for (a, b) ∈ r. the set of prefer relat over altern k is denot l(k). altern, we can view l(k) as the set of all permut of k. thu, we shall sometim us a permut of k to denot a member of l(k). for exampl, when k = {a, b, c}, we will sometim us the express acb to denot the relat {(a, c), (a, b), (c, b), (a, a), (b, b), (c, c)}. arb mean that b is  prefer over a if a and b ar differ. rs denot the irreflex version of r, i.e., rs = r \ {(a, a) : a ∈ k}. ar b mean that b is prefer over a and that a b. a prefer profil for Σ over altern k is a tupl (r1, . . . , rn) ∈ l(k)n , consist of on prefer relat ri for each agent i. a social welfar function (swf) is a function f : l(k)n → l(k) map each prefer profil to an aggreg prefer  relat. the class of all swf over altern k is denot f (k). properti of swf f correspond to the judgment  aggreg rule properti discuss in section 2.1 ar: the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 567 non-dictatorship (nd2) ¬∃i∈Σ∀(r1, . . . , rn) ∈ l(k)n f(r1, . . . , rn) = ri (correspond to nd1) independ of irrelev altern (iia) ∀(r1, . . . , rn) ∈ l(k)n ∀(s1, . . . , sn) ∈ l(k)n ∀a ∈ k∀b ∈ k((∀i ∈ Σ(arib ⇔ asib)) ⇒ (af(r1, . . . , rn)b ⇔ af(s1, . . . , sn)b)) (correspond to ind) pareto optim (po) ∀(r1, . . . , rn) ∈ l(k)n ∀a ∈ k∀b ∈ k ((∀i ∈ Σar i b) ⇒af(r1, . . . , rn)s b) (correspond to una) arrow"s theorem sai that the three properti abov ar  inconsist if there ar more than two altern. theorem 1 (arrow). if there ar more than two altern, no swf ha all the properti po, nd2 and iia. 3. judgment aggreg logic: syntax and semant the languag of judgment aggreg logic (jal) is  parameteris by a set of agent Σ = {1, 2, . . . , n} (we will assum that there ar at least two agent) and an agenda a. the follow atom proposit ar us: Π = {i, σ, hp | p ∈ a, i ∈ Σ} the languag l(Σ, a) of jal is defin by the follow grammar: φ ::= α | φ | φ | φ ∧ φ | ¬φ where α ∈ Π. thi languag will be formal interpret in  structur consist of an agenda item, a judgment profil and a  judgment aggreg function; inform, i mean that the agenda item is in agent i"s judgment set in the current judgment profil; σ mean that the agenda item is in the aggreg judgment set of the current judgment profil; hp mean that the agenda item is p; φ mean that φ is true in everi judgment profil; φ mean that φ is true in everi agenda item. we defin ψ = ¬ ¬ψ, intuit mean ψ is true for some judgment profil, and ψ = ¬ ¬ψ, intuit mean ψ is true for some agenda item, as usual, in addit to the usual deriv proposit connect. we now defin the formal semant of l(Σ, a). a model wrt. l(Σ, a) and underli logic l is a judgment aggreg rule f over a. recal that j(a, l)n denot the set of complet and  lconsist judgment profil over a. a tabl is a tupl t = f, γ, p such that f is a model, γ ∈ j(a, l)n and p ∈ a. a formula is interpret on a tabl as follow. f, γ, p |=l hq ⇔ p = q f, γ, p |=l i ⇔ p ∈ γi f, γ, p |=l σ ⇔ p ∈ f(γ) f, γ, p |=l ψ ⇔ ∀γ ∈ j(a, l)n f, γ , p |=l ψ f, γ, p |=l ψ ⇔ ∀p ∈ a f, γ, p |=l ψ f, γ, p |=l φ ∧ ψ ⇔ f, γ, p |=l φ and f, γ, p |=l ψ f, γ, p |=l ¬φ ⇔ f, γ, p |=l φ so, e.g., we have that f, γ, p |=l i∈Σ i if everybodi choos p in γ. exampl 1. a committe of three agent ar vote on the  follow three proposit: the candid is qualifi (p), if the candid is qualifi he will get an offer (p → q), and the candid will get an offer (q). on possibl vote scenario is illustr in the left part of tabl 1. in the tabl, the result of proposit-wise major vote, i.e., the jar fmaj accept a proposit iff it is accept by a major of the agent, ar also p p → q q 1 ye ye ye 2 no ye ye 3 ye no no fmaj ye ye ye 1 mdc 2 mcd 3 cmd fmaj mcd tabl 1: exampl shown. thi exampl can be model by take the agenda to be a = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q} (recal that agenda ar close under singl negat) and l to be proposit logic. the agent" vote can be model by the follow judgment profil: γ = γ1, γ2, γ3 , where γ1 = {p, p → q, q}, γ2 = {¬p, p → q, q}, γ3 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q}. we then have that: • fmaj, γ, p |=l 1 ∧ ¬2 ∧ 3 (agent 1 and 3 judg p to be true in the profil γ, while agent 2 doe not) • fmaj, γ, p |=l σ (major vote on p given the prefer profil γ lead to accept of p) • fmaj, γ, p |=l (1 ∧ 2) (agent 1 and 2 agre on some agenda item, under the judgment profil γ. note that thi formula doe not depend on which agenda item is on the tabl.) • fmaj, γ, p |=l ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1 ↔ 3)) (there is some judgment profil on which all agent agre on p. note that thi formula doe not depend on which judgment profil is on the tabl.) • fmaj, γ, p |=l ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1 ↔ 3)) (there is some judgment profil on which all agent agre on all agenda item. note that thi formula doe not depend on ani of the element on the tabl.) • fmaj, γ, p |=l σ ↔ g⊆{1,2,3},|g|≥2 i∈g i (the jar fmaj  implement major vote) we write f |=l φ iff f, γ, p |=l φ for everi γ over a and p ∈ a; |=l φ iff f |=l φ for all model f. given a possibl properti of a jar, such as, e.g., independ, we sai that a formula express the properti if the formula is true in an aggreg rule f iff f ha the properti. note that when we ar given a formula φ ∈ l(Σ, a), valid, i.e., |=l φ, is defin with respect to model of the particular  languag l(Σ, a) defin over the particular agenda a (and similar for valid with respect to a jar, i.e., f |=l φ). the agenda, like the set of agent Σ, is given when we defin the languag, and is thu implicit in the interpret of the languag1 . let an outcom o be a maxim conjunct of liter (¬)1, . . . , (¬)n. the set o is the set of all possibl outcom. note that the decis of the societi is not incorpor here: an outcom onli collect vote of agent from Σ. 3.1 model check model check is current on of the most activ area of  research with respect to reason in modal logic [4], and it is natur to investig the complex of thi problem for judgment  aggreg logic. intuit, the model check problem for judgment aggreg logic is as follow: given f, γ, p and formula φ of jal, is it the case that f, γ, p |= φ or not? 1 likewis, in classic modal logic the languag is parameteris with a set of primit proposit, and valid is defin with respect to all model with valuat over that particular set. 568 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) while thi problem is easi to understand mathemat, it present some difficulti if we want to analys it from a comput point of view. specif, the problem li in the  represent of the judgment aggreg rule, f. recal that thi  function map judgment profil to complet and consist judgment set. a jar must be defin for all judgment profil over some agenda, i.e., it must produc an output for all these possibl  input. but how ar we to repres such a rule? the simplest  represent of a function f : x → y is as the set of order pair {(x, y) | x ∈ x & y = f(x)}. howev, thi is not a feasibl  represent for jar, as there will be exponenti mani judgment profil in the size of the agenda, and so the represent would be unfeas larg in practic. if we did assum thi  represent for jar, then it is not hard to see that model check for our logic would be decid in polynomi time: the naiv algorithm, deriv from semant, serv thi purpos. howev, we emphasis that thi result is of no practic  signific, sinc it assum an unreason represent for model - a represent that simpli could not be us in practic for  exampl of anyth other than trivial size. so, what is a more realist represent for jar? let us sai a represent rf of a jar f is reason if: (i) the size of rf is polynomi in the size of the agenda; and (ii) there is a  polynomi time algorithm a, which take as input a represent rf and a judgment profil γ, and produc as output f(γ). there ar, of cours, mani such represent rf for jar f. here, we will look at on veri gener on: where the jar is repres as a polynomi bound two-tape ture machin tf , which take on it first tape a judgment profil, and write on it second tape the result judgment set. the requir that the ture  machin should be polynomi bound roughli correspond to the requir that a jar is reason to comput; if there is some jar that cannot be repres by such a machin, then it is  arguabl of littl valu, sinc it could not be us in practic2 . with such a represent, we can investig the complex of our model check problem. in modal logic, the usual sourc of complex, over and abov the classic logic connect, is the modal oper. with  respect to judgment aggreg logic, the oper quantifi over all judgment profil, and henc over all consist subset of the agenda. it follow that thi is a rather power oper: as we will see, it can be us as an np oracl [9, p.339]. in contrast, the  oper quantifi over member of the agenda, and is henc much weaker, from a comput perspect (we can think of it as a conjunct over element of the agenda). the power of the quantifi suggest that the complex of model check judgment aggreg logic over rel  succinct represent of jar is go to be rel high; we now prove that the complex of model check judgment aggreg logic is as hard as solv a polynomi number of np-hard  problem [9, pp.424-429]. theorem 2. the model check problem for judgment  aggreg logic, assum the represent of jar describ abov, is Δp 2-hard; it is np-hard even if the formula to be check is of the form ψ, where ψ contain no further or oper. proof. for Δp 2-hard, we reduc snsat (sequenti nest 2 of cours, we have no gener wai of check whether ani given ture machin is guarante to termin in polynomi time; the problem is undecid. as a consequ, we cannot alwai check whether a particular ture machin represent of a jar meet our requir. howev, thi doe not prevent specif jar be so repres, with correspond proof that thei termin in polynomi time. satisfi). an instanc is given by a seri of equat of the form z1 = ∃x1.φ1(x1) z2 = ∃x2.φ2(x2, z1) z3 = ∃x3.φ3(x3, z1, z2) . . . zk = ∃xk.φk(xk, z1, . . . , zk−1) where x1, . . . , xk ar disjoint set of variabl, and each φi(y) is a proposit logic formula over the variabl y; the idea is we first check whether φ1(x1) is satisfi, and if it is, we assign z1 the valu true, otherwis assign it fals; we then check whether φ2 is satisfi under the assumpt that z1 take the valu just deriv, and so on. thu the result of each equat depend on the valu of the previou on. the goal is to determin whether zk is true. to reduc thi problem to judgment aggreg logic model check, we first fix the jar: thi rule simpli copi whatev agent 1"s judgment set is. (clearli thi can be implement by a polynomi bound ture machin.) the agenda is assum to contain the variabl x1 ∪ · · · ∪ xk ∪ {z1, . . . , zk} and their negat. we fix the initi judgment profil γ to be x1 ∪· · ·∪xk ∪{z1, . . . , zk}, and fix p = x1. given a variabl xi, defin x∗ i to be (hxi ∧1). if φi is on of the formula φ1, . . . , φk, defin φ∗ i to be the formula obtain from φi by systemat substitut x∗ i for each variabl xi and z∗ i similarli. now, we defin the function ξi for natur number i > 0 as: ξk = z∗ 1 ↔ (φ∗ 1) if i = 1 z∗ i ↔ (φ∗ i ∧i−1 j=1 ξj) otherwis. and we defin the formula to be model check as: φ∗ k ∧k−1 j=1 ξj it is now straightforward from construct that thi formula is true under the interpret iff zk is true in the snsat instanc. the proof of the latter half of the theorem is immedi from the special case where k = 1. 3.2 some properti we have thu defin a languag which can be us to express properti of judgment aggreg rule. an interest question is then: what ar the univers properti of aggreg rule  express in the languag; which formula ar valid? here, in order to illustr the logic, we discuss some of these logic properti. in section 5 we give a complet axiomatis of all of them. recal that we defin the set o of outcom as the set of all conjunct with exactli on, possibl negat, atom from Σ. let p = {o ∧ σ, o ∧ ¬σ : o ∈ o}; p ∈ p complet describ the decis of the agent and the aggreg function. let denot exclus or. we have that: |=l p∈pp - ani agent and the jar alwai have to make a decis |=l (i ∧ ¬j) → ¬i - if some agent can think differ about an item than i doe, then also i can chang hi mind about it. in fact thi principl can be strengthen to |=l ( i ∧ ¬j) → (¬i ∧ j) |=l x - for ani x ∈ {i, ¬i, σ, ¬σ : i ∈ Σ} - both the individu agent and the jar will alwai judg some agenda item to be true, and convers, some agenda item to be fals |=l (i ∧ j) - there exist admiss judgment set such that agent i and j agre on some judgment. |=l (i ↔ j) - there exist admiss judgment set such that agent i and j alwai agre. the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 569 the interpret of formula depend on the agenda a and the underli logic l, in the quantif over the set j(a, l)n of  admiss, e.g., complet and l-consist, judgment profil. note that thi mean that some jal formula might be valid under on  underli logic, while not under anoth. for exampl, if the agenda contain some formula which is inconsist in the underli logic (and, by implic, some tautolog), then the follow hold: |=l (i ∧ σ) - for everi judgment profil, there is some agenda item (take a tautolog) which both agent i and the jar judg to be true but thi properti doe not hold when everi agenda item is  consist with respect to the underli logic. on such agenda and underli logic will be discuss in section 6. 4. express exampl non-dictatorship can be express as follow: nd = i∈Σ ¬(σ ↔ i) (1) lemma 1. f |=l nd iff f ha the properti nd1. independ can be express as follow: ind = o∈o ((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2) lemma 2. f |=l ind iff f ha the properti ind. unanim can be express as follow: una = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3) lemma 3. f |=l una iff f ha the properti una. 4.1 the discurs paradox as illustr in exampl 1, the follow formula express proposit-wise major vote over some proposit p mv = σ ↔ g⊆Σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i (4) i.e., the follow properti of a jar f and admiss profil a1, . . . , an : p ∈ f(a1, . . . , an) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ ai}| > |{i : p ai}| f |= mv exactli iff f ha the abov properti for all judgment  profil and proposit. howev, we have the

⊥) when there ar at least three agent and the agenda contain at least two distinct formula and their materi implic. proof. assum the opposit, e.g., that a = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and there exist an aggreg rule f over a such that f |=l (σ ↔ g⊆Σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i). let γ be the  judgment profil γ = a1, a2, a3 where a1 = {p, p → q, q, . . .}, a2 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and a3 = {¬p, p → q, ¬q, . . .}. we have that f, γ, p |=l (σ ↔ g⊆Σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i) for ani p , so f, γ, p |=l σ ↔ g⊆Σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i. becaus f, γ, p |=l 1 ∧ 2, it follow that f, γ, p |=l σ. in a similar manner it follow that f, γ, p → q |=l σ and f, γ, q |=l ¬σ. in other word, p ∈ f(γ), p → q ∈ f(γ) and q f(γ). sinc f(γ) is complet, ¬q ∈ f(γ). but that contradict the fact that f(γ) is requir to be consist. proposit 1 is a logic statement of a variant of the well-known discurs dilemma: if three agent ar vote on proposit p, q and p → q, proposit-wise major vote might not yield a consist result. 5.

determin a tabl, except for the behaviour of f. to be more precis, let a tabl descript be a conjunct of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. it is easi to see that tabl descript ar mutual exclus, and, moreov, we can deriv τ∈t τ, where t is the set of all tabl descript. let d be the set of all  maxim consist set Δ. we don"t want all of those: it might well be that ψ requir σ to be in a certain wai, which is incompat with some Δ"s. we defin two access relat in the standard wai: r Δ1Δ2 iff for all ψ: ψ ∈ Δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ Δ2. similarli for r with respect to . both relat ar equival (due to taut-5), and moreov, when r Δ1Δ2 and r Δ2Δ3 then for some Δ2, also r Δ1Δ2 and r Δ2Δ3 (becaus of axiom comm). let Δ0 be a mc contain ψ. we now defin the set tabl = {Δ0} ∪ {Δ1, Δ2 | (r Δ0Δ1 and r Δ1Δ2) or (r Δ0Δ1 and r Δ1Δ2)} everi Δ ∈ tabl can be conceiv as a pair γ, p, sinc everi Δ contain a uniqu (hq ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ) for everi hq and a uniqu hp. it is then easi to verifi that, for everi Δ ∈ tabl, and everi formula ϕ, Δ |= ϕ iff ϕ ∈ Δ, where |= here mean truth in the ordinari modal logic sens when the set of state is taken to be tabl. now, we extract an aggreg function f and pair γ, p as follow: for everi Δ ∈ tabl, find a conjunct hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. there will be exactli on such p. thi defin the p we ar look for. furthermor, the γ is obtain, for everi agent i, by find all q for which (hq ∧ i) is current true. final, the function f is a tabl of all tupl hp, o(p), σ for which (hp ∧ o(o) ∧ σ) is contain in some set in tabl. we point out that jal ha all the axiom taut, k, t, 4, 5 and the rule mp and nec of the modal logic s5. howev, uniform  substitut, a principl of all normal modal logic (cf., e.g., [3]), doe not hold. a counter exampl is the fact that the follow is valid: σ (5) - no matter what prefer the agent have, the jar will alwai make some judgment - while thi is not valid: (σ ∧ i) (6) - the jar will not necessarili make the same judgment as agent i. so, for exampl, we have that the discurs paradox is provabl in jal(l): jal(l) (( mv) → ⊥). an exampl of a deriv of the less complic (valid) properti (i ∧ j) is shown in tabl 3. 6. prefer aggreg recent, dietrich and list [5] show that prefer  aggreg can be embed in judgment aggreg. in thi section we show that our judgment aggreg logic also can be us to  reason about prefer aggreg. given a set k of altern, [5] defin a simpl predic logic lk with languag l(lk ) as follow: • l(lk ) ha on constant a for each altern a ∈ k,  variabl v1, v2, . . ., a binari ident predic =, a binari  predic p for strict prefer, and the usual proposit and first order connect • z is the collect of the follow axiom: - ∀v1 ∀v2 (v1pv2 → ¬v2pv1) - ∀v1 ∀v2 ∀v3 ((v1pv2 ∧ v2pv3) → v1pv3) - ∀v1 ∀v2 (¬v1 = v2 → (v1pv2 ∨ v2pv1)) • when Γ ⊆ l(lk ) and φ is a formula, Γ |= φ is defin to hold iff Γ ∪ z entail φ in the standard sens of predic logic 1 (hp ∧ i) ∨ (hp ∧ i) cpj(i) 2 (hp ∧ j) ∨ (hp ∧ j) cpj(j) 3 call 1 a ∨ b and 2 c ∨ d abbrevi, 1, 2 4 (a ∧ c) ∨ (a ∧ d) ∨ (b ∧

easi to see that there is an on-to-on correspond between the set of prefer relat (total linear order) over k and the set of lk -consist and complet judgment set over the prefer agenda ak = {apb, ¬apb : a, b ∈ k, a b} given a swf f over k, the correspond jar ff over the  prefer agenda ak is defin as follow ff (a1, . . . , an) = a, where a is the consist and complet judgment set correspond to f(l1, . . . , ln) where li is the prefer relat correspond to the consist and complet judgment set ai. thu we can us jal to reason about prefer aggreg as follow. take the logic languag l(Σ, ak ), for some set of agent Σ, and take the underli logic to be lk . we can then interpret our formula in an swf f over k, a prefer profil l ∈ l(k) and a pair (a, b) ⊆ k × k, a b, as follow: f, l, (a, b) |=swf φ ⇔ ff , γl , apb |=lk φ where γl is the judgment profil correspond to the prefer profil l. while in the gener judgment aggreg case a formula is  interpret in the context of an agenda item, in the prefer  aggreg case a formula is thu interpret in the context of a pair of altern. exampl 2. three agent must decid between go to dinner (d), a movi (m) or a concert (c). their individu prefer ar illustr on the right in tabl 1 in section 3, along with the result of a swf fmaj implement pair-wise major vote. let l = mdc, mcd, cmd be the prefer profil correspond to the prefer in the exampl. we have the follow: • fmaj, l, (m, d) |=swf 1 ∧ 2 ∧ 3 (all agent agre, under the individu rank l, on the rel rank of m and  dthei agre that d is better than m) • fmaj, l, (m, d) |=swf ¬(1 ↔ 2) (under the individu  rank l, there is some pair of altern on which agent 1 and 2 disagre) the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) 571 • fmaj, l, (m, d) |=swf (1 ∧ 2) (agent 1 and 2 can choos their prefer such that thei will agre on some pair of altern) • fmaj, l, (m, d) |=swf σ ↔ g⊆{1,2,3},|g|≥2 i∈g i (the swf fmaj implement pair-wise major vote) as usual, we write f |=swf φ when f, l, (a, b) |=swf φ for ani l and (a, b), and so on. thu, our formula can be seen as express properti of social welfar function. exampl 3. take the formula (i ↔ σ). when thi formula is interpret as a statement about a social welfar function, it sai that there exist a prefer profil such that for all pair (a, b) of altern, b is prefer over a in the aggreg (by the swf) of the prefer profil if and onli if agent i prefer b over a. 6.1 express exampl we make precis the claim in section 2.2 that the three  mention swf properti correspond to the three mention jar  properti, respect. recal the formula defin in section 4. proposit 2. f |=swf nd iff f ha the properti nd2 f |=swf ind iff f ha the properti iia f |=swf una iff f ha the properti po the properti express abov ar properti of swf. let us now look at properti of the set of altern k we can express. properti involv cardin is often of interest, for exampl in arrow"s theorem. let: mt2 = ( (1 ∧ 2) ∧ (1 ∧ ¬2)) proposit 3. let f ∈ f (k). |k| > 2 iff f |=swf mt2. proof. for the direct to the left, let f |=swf mt2. thu, there is a γ such that there exist (a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ) ∈ k × k, where a1 b1 , and a2 b2 , such that (i) a1 pb1 ∈ γ1, (ii) a1 pb1 ∈ γ2, (iii) a2 pb2 ∈ γ1 and (iv) a2 pb2 γ2. from (ii) and (iv) we get that (a1 , b1 ) (a2 , b2 ), and from that and (i) and (iii) it follow that γ1 contain two differ pair a1 pb1 and a2 pb2 each have two differ element. but that is not possibl if |k| = 2, becaus if k = {a, b} then ak = {apb, ¬apb, bpa, ¬bpa} and thu it is imposs that γ1 ⊆ ak sinc we cannot have apb, bpa ∈ γ1. for the direct to the right, let |k| > 2; let a, b, c be three distinct element of k. let γ1 be the judgment set correspond to the rank abc and γ2 the judgment set correspond to acb. now, for ani aggreg rule f, f, γ, apb |= 1 ∧ 2 and f, γ, bpc |= 1 ∧ ¬2. thu, f |=swf mt2, for ani swf f. we now have everyth we need to express arrow"s statement as a formula. it follow from hi theorem that the formula is valid on the class of all social welfar function. theorem 4. |=swf mt2 → ¬(po ∧ nd ∧ iia) proof. note that mt2, po, nd and iia ar true swf properti, their truth valu wrt. a tabl is determin sole by the swf. for exampl, f, l, (a, b) |=swf mt2 iff f |= mt2, for ani f, l, a, b. let f ∈ f (k), and f, l, (a, b) |=swf mt2 for some l and a, b. by proposit 3, k ha more than two altern. by arrow"s  theorem, f cannot have all the properti po, nd2 and iia. w.l.o.g assum that f doe not have the po properti. by proposit 2, f |=swf po. sinc po is a swf properti, thi mean that f, l, (a, b) |=swf po (satisfact of po is independ of l, a, b), and thu that f, l, (a, b) |=swf ¬po ∨ ¬nd ∨ ¬iia. note that the formula in theorem 4 doe not mention ani agenda item (i.e., pair of altern) such as hapb directli in an  express. thi mean that the formula is a member of l(Σ, ak ) for ani set of altern k, and is valid no matter which set of altern we assum. the formula mv which in the gener judgment aggreg case express proposit-wise major vote, express in the  prefer aggreg case pair-wise major vote, as illustr in exampl 2. the prefer aggreg correspond to the  discurs paradox of judgment aggreg is the well known  condorcet"s vote paradox, state that pair-wise major vote can lead to aggreg prefer which ar cyclic (even if the  individu prefer ar not). we can express condorcet"s paradox as follow, again as a univers valid logic properti of swf. proposit 4. |=swf mt2 → ¬mv, when there ar at least three agent. proof. the proof is similar to the proof of the discurs  paradox. let ff , γ, apb |=lk mt2; there ar thu three distinct  element a, b, c ∈ k. assum that ff , γ, apb |=lk mv. let γ be the judgment profil correspond to the prefer  profil x = (abc, cab, bca). we have that ff , γ , apb |=lk 1 ∧ 2 and, sinc ff , γ , apb |=lk mv, we have that ff , γ , apb |=lk σ and thu that apb ∈ ff (γ ) and (a, b) ∈ f(x). in a similar manner we get that (c, a) ∈ f(x) and (b, c) ∈ f(x). but that is imposs, sinc by transit we would also have that (a, c) ∈ f(x) which  contradict the fact that f(x) is antisymmetr. thu, it follow that ff , γ, apb |=lk mv. 6.2 axiomatis and logic properti we immedi get, from theorem 3, a sound and complet axiomatis of prefer aggreg over a finit set of  altern. corollari 1. if the set of altern k is finit, we have that for ani formula ψ ∈ l(Σ, ak ), jal(lk ) ψ iff |=swf ψ. proof. follow immedi from theorem 3 and the fact that for ani jar f, there is a swf f such that f = ff . so, for exampl, arrow"s theorem is provabl in jal(lk ): jal(lk ) mt2 → ¬(po ∧ nd ∧ iia). everi formula which is valid with respect to judgment  aggreg rule is also valid with respect to social welfar function, so all gener logic properti of jar ar also properti of swf. depend on the agenda, swf mai have addit properti, induc by the logic lk , which ar not alwai share by jar with other underli logic. on such properti is i. while we have |=swf i, for other agenda there ar underli logic l such that |=l i to see the latter, take an agenda with a formula p which is  inconsist in the underli logic l - p can never be includ in a judgment set. to see the former, take an arbitrari pair of  altern (a, b). there exist some prefer profil in which agent i prefer b over a. technic speak, the formula i hold in swf becaus the agenda ak doe not contain a formula which (alon) is inconsist wrt. the underli logic lk . by the same reason, the follow properti also hold in swf but not in jar in gener. |=swf o∈o o 572 the sixth intl. joint conf. on autonom agent and multi-agent system (aama 07) - for ani pair of altern (a, b), ani possibl combin of the rel rank of a and b among the agent is possibl. |=swf i → ¬i - given an altern b which is prefer over some other  altern a by agent i, there is some other pair of altern c and d such that d is not prefer over c - name (c, d) = (b, a). |=swf ( (i ∨ j) → (i ∧ ¬j)) - if, given prefer of agent and a swf, for ani two altern it is alwai the case that either agent i or agent j prefer the second altern over the first, then there must exist a pair of altern for which the two agent disagre. a justif is that no singl agent can prefer the second altern over the first for everi pair of altern, so in thi case if i prefer b over a then j must prefer a over b. again, thi properti doe not necessarili hold for other agenda, becaus the agenda might contain an inconsist the agent could not possibl disagre upon. proof theoret, these addit properti of swf ar  deriv us the closur rule. 7. relat work formal logic relat to social choic have focus mostli on the logic represent of prefer when the set of altern is larg and on the comput properti of comput aggreg prefer for a given represent [6, 7, 8]. a notabl and recent except is a logic framework for  judgment aggreg develop by marc pauli in [10], in order to be abl to characteris the logic relationship between differ  judgment aggreg rule. while the motiv is similar to the work in thi paper, the approach ar fundament differ: in [10], the possibl result from appli a rule to some judgment  profil ar taken as primari and describ axiomat; in our  approach the aggreg rule and it possibl input, i.e., judgment profil, ar taken as primari and describ axiomat. the two approach do not seem to be directli relat to each other in the sens that on can be embed in the other. the modal logic arrow logic [11] is design to reason about ani object that can be graphic repres as an arrow, and ha  variou modal oper for express properti of and relationship between these arrow. in the prefer aggreg logic jal(lk ) we interpret formula in pair of altern - which can be seen as arrow. thu, (at least) the prefer aggreg variant of our logic is relat to arrow logic. howev, while the modal oper of arrow logic can express properti of prefer relat such as transit, thei cannot directli express most of the properti we have discuss in thi paper. nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investig further in futur work. in  particular, arrow logic ar usual proven complet wrt. an algebra. thi could mean that it might be possibl to us such algebra as the underli structur to repres individu and collect  prefer. then, chang the prefer profil take us from on algebra to anoth, and a swf determin the collect prefer, in each of the algebra. 8. discuss we have present a sound and complet logic jal for  repres and reason about judgment aggreg. jal is express: it can express judgment aggreg rule such as major vote; complic properti such as independ; and import result such as the discurs paradox, arrow"s theorem and condorcet"s paradox. we argu that these result show exactli which logic capabl an agent need in order to be abl to reason about  judgment aggreg. it is perhap surpris that a rel simpl languag provid these capabl. jal provid a proof theori, in which result such as those mention abov can be deriv3 . the axiomatis describ the logic principl of judgment aggreg, and can also be instanti to reason about specif instanc of judgment aggreg, such as classic arrovian  prefer aggreg. thu our framework shed light on the  differ between the logic principl behind gener judgment aggreg on the on hand and classic prefer aggreg on the other. in futur work it would be interest to relax the complet and consist requir of judgment set, and try to  characteris these in the logic languag, as properti of gener  judgment set, instead. 9. acknowledg we thank the anonym review for their help remark. thoma Ågotn" work on thi paper wa support
